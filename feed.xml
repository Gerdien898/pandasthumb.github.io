&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2021/JTBHBG2021.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;JTB IDcreationist paper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They never give any evidence that any known complex adaptation had to evolve through their imaginary scenario, so the relevance of their paper to real biology is only that, imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the paper does sort of casually mention by name a number of complex adaptations that evolved in a (geologically speaking) short amount of time, Hössjer et al. never give any evidence that any of these adaptations actually evolved or &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to evolve through their imaginary scenario. Only this short section of the paper is what appears to try to connect their hypothetical scenario to the real world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For more complex adaptations of a species, it is necessary that several genes are modified in a &lt;em&gt;coordinated&lt;/em&gt; manner, either through mutations in the coding sequence, or through changed expression of these &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; genes. For instance, the fossil record is often interpreted as having long periods of stasis (Voje et al., 2018), interrupted by more abrupt changes and “explosive” origins (Bechly and Meyer, 2017). These changes include, for instance, the evolution of life (Bell et al., 2015), photosynthesis (Hecht, 2013), multicellularity and the “Avalon Explosion” (Shen et al., 2008), animal body plans and the “Cambrian Explosion” (Erwin and Valentine, 2013), complex eyes (Paterson et al., 2011), vertebrate jaws and teeth (Fraser et al., 2010), terrestrialization (e.g., in vascular plants, arthropods, and tetrapods) (Bateman et al., 1998), insect metamorphosis (Labandeira, 2011), animal flight and feathers (Wu et al., 2018, Yang et al., 2019), reproductive systems, including angiosperm flowers, amniote eggs, and the mammalian placenta (Chuong, 2013, Doyle, 2012, Roberts et al., 2016, Sauquet, 2017, Specht and Bartlett, 2009), echolocation in whales (Churchill et al., 2016, Park et al., 2016) and bats (Simmons et al., 2008), and even cognitive skills of modern man (Neubauer et al., 2018). Based on radiometric dating of the available windows of time in the fossil record, these genetic changes are believed to have happened very quickly on a macroevolutionary timescale. In order to evaluate the chances for a neo-Darwinian process to bring about such major phenotypic changes, it is important to give rough but reasonable estimates of the time it would take for a population to evolve so that the required multiple genetic changes occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we read carefully with comprehension we see that none of these references even remotely indicate that the complex adaptations listed would have to evolve through the scenario Hössjer et al. go on to model. 
They start by simply asserting (my bold) that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For more complex adaptations of a species, &lt;strong&gt;it is necessary&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;em&gt;several genes&lt;/em&gt; are modified in a &lt;em&gt;coordinated&lt;/em&gt; manner, either through mutations in the coding sequence, or through changed expression of these &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give no reference to substantiate that it is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for any of their following list of complex adaptations to have evolved with &lt;em&gt;“multiple genes”&lt;/em&gt; being modified in a &lt;em&gt;coordinated manner&lt;/em&gt; like the one they model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really all one needs to say about this paper with respect to its relevance to real biology. It’s a typical example of GIGO, where the conclusion you derive from your calculation is entirely dictated by the reality of the assumptions you base them on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also another example of creationist papers focused on so-called “waiting time problems” with evolution, which are typically based on the entirely imaginary - and totally dubious premise - that there are “target sequences” that evolution must find and evolve towards without any input by natural selection, by mutating incrementally from some random ancestral sequence until the correct (or almost correct) “target” sequence is produced by the chance accumulation of mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To nobody’s surprise, the longer the target sequence is, the longer it will take before chance mutations happen to produce it or something very near to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for creationists, this imaginary scenario has next to nothing to do with how potential new genes gain regulatory promoter sequences. In real biology the background low-level affinities between DNA binding proteins and DNA sequences ensures that there’s almost always &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; activity for selection to act on to improve the binding between a transcription factor and a promoter sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to calculate the probability of evolving this interaction with “targets” that have to match near-perfectly - from some random ancestor - with zero real chemical or biophysical input, biochemists have done even better and experimentally evolved promoters in the lab.  It turns out this is surprisingly easy for evolution. In an experiment with E coli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04026-w&quot;&gt;(Yona et al. 2018)&lt;/a&gt; approximately &lt;strong&gt;~60%&lt;/strong&gt; of random DNA sequences are &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; mutation away from turning into a selectively useful transcriptional promoter, and &lt;strong&gt;~10%&lt;/strong&gt; of random DNA sequences are functional promoters just by chance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random sequences rapidly evolve into de novo promoters&lt;/strong&gt;
Avihu H. Yona, Eric J Alm &amp;amp; Jeff Gore&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;
How new functions arise de novo is a fundamental question in evolution. We studied de novo evolution of promoters in Escherichia coli by replacing the lac promoter with various random sequences of the same size (~100 bp) and evolving the cells in the presence of lactose. We find that ~60% of random sequences can evolve expression comparable to the wild-type with only one mutation, and that ~10% of random sequences can serve as active promoters even without evolution. Such a short mutational distance between random sequences and active promoters may improve the evolvability, yet may also lead to accidental promoters inside genes that interfere with normal expression. Indeed, our bioinformatic analyses indicate that E. coli was under selection to reduce accidental promoters inside genes by avoiding promoter-like sequences. We suggest that a low threshold for functionality balanced by selection against undesired targets can increase the evolvability by making new beneficial features more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

Ms. Reid notes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;even though the overwhelming likelihood remains that SARS-CoV-2 evolved naturally, the accidental-escape theory hasn’t been ruled out. Still, there are a lot of reasons why that scenario is unlikely. Foremost among them, to my mind, is that it’s hard to imagine how a wild bat virus could evolve the ability to be both infectious to humans and transmissible between humans in a highly controlled laboratory environment, even admitting the possibility of occasional safety lapses (which have so far only been rumored, not proven). Remember, the most closely related bat virus — which cannot infect humans — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0771-4&quot;&gt;differs at over 1,200 nucleotides&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, making a good-faith effort to rule out that possibility is important, and that is why a group of prominent scientists recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1&quot;&gt;called for a new investigation&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that an earlier one was not as thorough as it should have been.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Reid gives short shrift to the “theory” that the virus was released deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controversy may have begun in earnest on May 5, when the science journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Wade&quot;&gt;Nicholas Wade&lt;/a&gt; in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists asked, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/&quot;&gt;Did people or nature open Pandora’s box at Wuhan?&lt;/a&gt; Mr. Wade is a former reporter for Science and the New York Times, and holds a bachelor of arts degree in natural sciences. He has written an interesting article, but in the end he blames “Trump Derangement Syndrome” (my characterization, not his) for scientists’ unwillingness to consider the lab-leak hypothesis. Whatever the merits of his article, he begins his conclusion with these loaded sentences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; If the case that SARS2 originated in a lab is so substantial, why isn’t this more widely known? As may now be obvious, there are many people who have reason not to talk about it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy “theory” continues, blaming scientists, for example, for failure to rock the boat and risk their funding. Mr. Wade’s article finally concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; The common sense perception that a pandemic breaking out in Wuhan might have something to do with a Wuhan lab cooking up novel viruses of maximal danger in unsafe conditions could eventually displace the ideological insistence that whatever Trump said can’t be true. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, apparently on the strength of Mr. Wade’s article, the Bulletin plans a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/events/&quot;&gt; virtual program &lt;/a&gt; to discuss Mr. Wade’s “groundbreaking article,” featuring Mr. Wade himself, Bulletin editor-in-chief John Mecklin, and Bulletin president and CEO Rachel Bronson. And not an epidemiologist or virologist in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 14, David Relman of Stanford and 17 colleagues published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1&quot;&gt;letter to the editor&lt;/a&gt; of Science magazine; Dr. Relman and his colleagues are the “group of prominent scientists” to whom Ms. Reid refers. The authors are all biologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, and so on. They say, primarily, that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA73/A73_R1-en.pdf&quot;&gt;report by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; did not give sufficient consideration to the possibility of an accident or a leak from the virology laboratory and should not have concluded so firmly that “a zoonotic spillover from an intermediate host as ‘likely to very likely,’ and a laboratory incident as ‘extremely unlikely.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to cherry-pick, but, as if to emphasize the political rather than the scientific, an article in Nature on May 27, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01383-3&quot;&gt;Divisive COVID ‘lab leak’ debate prompts dire warnings from researchers&lt;/a&gt;, quoted Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan as criticizing Dr. Relman and his colleagues for not considering “how [their article] would feed into the divisive political environment surrounding this issue.” Dr. Rasmussen added, “This debate has moved so far from the evidence that I don’t know if we can dial it back.” Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my head began to spin and my eyes lost their ability to focus on my monitor, I read a June 2 Washington Post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-bats-china-wuhan/2021/06/02/772ef984-beb2-11eb-922a-c40c9774bc48_story.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which, though largely a profile of a Chinese researcher, mentioned a very curious hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The report lent credence to China’s preferred theory that the virus could have come from overseas, possibly via frozen food imports — though Beijing has presented little support for that. On the question of a possible lab leak, the report concluded that pathway was “extremely unlikely.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite a conspiracy theory, but &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of conspiracies, I read a May 31 post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-origin-of-sars-cov-2-revisited/&quot;&gt;The origin of SARS-CoV-2, revisited&lt;/a&gt;, by the well known skeptic and medical doctor David Gorski. Dr. Gorski reminds us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]henever there is a major outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic of infectious disease, one conspiracy theory always—and I do mean always—arises. That conspiracy theory is that the causative microbe was developed in a laboratory and/or escaped a laboratory. HIV, H1N1, the original SARS, Ebola virus, every single one of them gave birth to such conspiracy theories. Unsurprisingly, given its global scope and death toll, so it was with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gorski article is long, and I cannot go into detail. He points out something, however, that ought to be obvious but apparently is not: &lt;i&gt;The fact that there are two hypotheses does not mean that they are equally probable.&lt;/i&gt; Thus, he concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The natural origin hypothesis tends to [be] the default for any new disease that arises for the simple reason that it is by far the most likely to be the correct explanation. It’s very common for viruses to mutate and evolve in animals and then jump over to humans and pandemics have been caused this way before. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biologist Jerry Coyne also weighed in on June 4, in a blog post entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/06/04/did-the-covid-19-virus-come-from-a-wuhan-lab-its-looking-increasingly-likely/&quot;&gt;Did the Covid-19 virus come from a Wuhan lab? It’s looking increasingly likely&lt;/a&gt;. By “it,” Dr. Coyne means an accidental release. He refers here to a Newsweek article, which I have not read; he writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a group of amateurs, following the lead of an (sic) young Indian called “The Seeker,” who determined that the sequence of the pandemic virus was almost identical to that of the virus stored in the WIV (they managed to get the latter sequence), and that that virus was likely the one who killed the three men nine years ago. They also found out, through diligent labor, that the WIV was actually studying the virus despite their denial, and had made seven trips to the guano mine to collect samples. The amateurs found grant proposals from the WIV, which was apparently testing the infectivity of the collected viruses, possibly with the hope of producing a vaccine against them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mildly skeptical of something put forward by a “group of amateurs,” and I mention this blog post largely because the comments were instructive, and some of these criticized aspects of Dr. Gorski’s article. A commenter, Douglas Healy, claimed, correctly, I think, “When you mix politics with science, what you get is politics.” The conclusion to Mr. Wade’s article certainly lends support to Mr. Healy’s hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me? I am not a biologist, only a fellow traveler. I found Ms. Reid’s advice not to jump the gun to be compelling, and I thought that Dr. Gorski’s observations about the number of failed conspiracy theories were right on target. Until I unearth further evidence, I shall consider “natural source” to be the odds-on favorite.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">In a dispassionate look at the Covid pandemic, on May 28, Ann Reid of the National Center for Science Education warns us not to jump the gun and assume that the pandemic was caused by a leak from the laboratory of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).

The eclipse occurred when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.space.com/super-flower-blood-moon-total-lunar-eclipse-2021-guide&quot;&gt;the Moon was approximately at perigee&lt;/a&gt; and looked about 10&amp;nbsp;% larger than usual.

The eclipse occurred just before sunrise, so the sky was becoming bright and the Moon was not visible during totality.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appears the Biologic Institute [An enterprise of the Discovery Institute] is history, green screen and all. On their 2019 990, Director Axe will no longer draw a salary, but will be a prof at Biola “Univ.” Office space is for rent. Location is listed as “permanently closed.” Their final 990 showed a loss of $133,000. [Emendation in original.] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked Guidestar for their latest IRS Form 990-EZ, which is dated 2019 and covers the fiscal year 2018 (Charity Navigator is a year behind). Sure enough, it contains the following statement on line 28:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;DR. AXE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH BIOLA UNIVERSITY TO SERVE AS THE MAXWELL VISITING PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY DURING THE 2018/2019 ACADEMIC YEAR, WITH REGULAR VISITS TO CAMPUS. IN AUGUST 2019, DR. AXE BECAME THE MAXWELL PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AT BIOLA, WORKING FULL TIME ON TEACHING AND WORKING TO HELP BUILD A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT AT BIOLA THAT INCLUDES ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. ALTHOUGH HE NO LONGER DRAWS A SALARY FROM BIOLOGIC INSTITUTE, DR. AXE CONTINUES TO SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR AND IS EXPLORING WAYS IN WHICH BIOLOGIC CAN PARTNER WITH BIOLA. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Dr. Axe” in question is Douglas Axe, the president of the Biologic Institute. His salary of $133,333 in 2018 was the bulk of the total expenses of $201,873. Revenue was $68,600, leaving a deficit almost exactly equal to Dr. Axe’s salary. Inasmuch as Dr. Axe “no longer draws a salary from Biologic Institute,” it seems safe to say that they are effectively out of business, even though he “is exploring ways in which Biologic can partner with Biola.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not very familiar with Biologic Institute, and reading a 2019 Form 990-EZ seems almost like reading ancient history, or at least medieval history, so I took a look at their website. The home page displays an undated article that was reposted from a 2017 article, followed by another article dated 2018. Medieval history indeed! Undiscouraged, I checked a tab labeled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biologicinstitute.org/research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;. After a long discussion of motivation, “core ideas,” and research areas, they list their publications. I will let other people discuss the content of the publications and will note only that the most recent is from 2014. Thus, unless the web page has simply been ignored, there has been little or no activity at the Biologic Institute since 2013 or 2014 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Biologic Institute is not dead, it has surely been moribund for the better part of the last decade. Where, I wonder, is their vaunted research program now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADDED 6:30 p.m., 05/23/2021:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A colleague sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, whence I scrolled down to “Charity … Search” and entered “Biologic Institute.” I quickly found the following, which suggests that they ceased operations on 09/30/2019 with a balance of $9285, which precisely matches the amount on the last Form 990_EZ that I could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evil that men do lives after them;&lt;br /&gt;
  
The good is oft interred with their bones.&lt;br /&gt;

&amp;mdash;Shakespeare, &lt;i&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask Thomas Henry Huxley if you do not believe Marc Antony. According to an article in AS Review, &lt;a href=&quot;https://asreview.org/2021/01/22/thomas-huxley-once-respected-now-rejected/&quot;&gt;Thomas Huxley: Once Respected, Now Rejected&lt;/a&gt;, a big brouhaha has erupted over the name of the Huxley College of the Environment at Western Washington University. The issue is important, because if people succeed in “canceling” Huxley, possibly Darwin will be next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huxley’s “sin” is to have held many of the same views regarding race as most of his contemporaries. More specifically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/Rupke%20Huxley%20Legacy.pdf&quot;&gt;according to the historian Nicolaas Rupke&lt;/a&gt;, Huxley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;formulated what became known as ‘Huxley’s Law’ or ‘Huxley’s Rule,’ which stated that the distance in biological, evolutionary development between the highest and lowest humans is greater than the distance between the lowest humans and the highest apes (chimpanzee, gorilla), thus degrading native peoples across the British Empire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, as nearly as I can determine, but the term Huxley’s Law is not in common use and appears to have been coined by Prof. Rupke himself, &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/Rupke%20-%20Huxley%27s%20Rule.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the distinguished philosopher of biology, David Hull, has noted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jstor.org/stable/3827456&quot;&gt;book review&lt;/a&gt; that “nothing today goes by the name of Huxley’s Law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president’s office at Western Washington University has &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/research-and-resources&quot;&gt;appointed a task force and solicited comments&lt;/a&gt; regarding renaming the College. They asked three questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; What role did Huxley’s beliefs on race occupy in his intellectual works, his public statements, and his life as a whole? Were they remarkable in the context of the time and place in which he lived? 

&lt;br /&gt;Did Huxley’s scientific work contribute, either in support or opposition, to the development of scientific racism and Social Darwinism, both during his lifetime and after? What portion of his total work did these contributions occupy, and how significant are those contributions in supporting or refuting the ideology of scientific racism?

&lt;br /&gt;What harmful institutional practices, policies, or general practical consequences, if any, can be specifically traced to Huxley’s views? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistently with the quotation from Shakespeare, above, they did not ask a single question about Huxley’s many accomplishments, which, I take it, are to be interred with his bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the submissions by Prof. Rupke, who is a professor of history at Washington and Lee University; &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/PS%20White%20Huxley%20Legacy.pdf&quot;&gt;Paul White&lt;/a&gt; of the Darwin Correspondence Project of the University of Cambridge; &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/Lyons%20Huxley%20Legacy.pdf&quot;&gt;Sherrie Lyons&lt;/a&gt; of Empire State College; &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-04/Reidy%20Huxley%20Legacy.pdf&quot;&gt;Michael Reidy&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of History, Montana State University; and an article in the Seattle Times, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/reconsider-cancel-culture-target-at-wwu/&quot;&gt;Reconsider cancel-culture target at WWU&lt;/a&gt;, by Steve Hollenhorst and Wayne Landis, both professors and administrators at Huxley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The submissions that I read, save that of Prof. Rupke and the AS Review article, seem to me to be generally favorable toward Huxley. If you want to read one piece, read the article by Hollenhorst and Landis. I think they get it about right: Huxley’s main crime was living in the 1800’s and sharing many of the attitudes of his contemporaries. But in fact he was well ahead of his contemporaries in being an abolitionist in a country that largely supported the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Sure, he thought that the British aristocracy was in some way superior to the “primitive” peoples in Africa or Australia; who in 1880 did not? Let us be careful to avoid the fallacy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)&quot;&gt;presentism&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his bias, Huxley opposed slavery and fought against social Darwinism on moral grounds. Even Lincoln, I should add parenthetically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/24/archives/a-letter-from-president-lincoln-reply-to-horace-greeley-slavery-and.html&quot;&gt;wrote in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, “If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might have been catty of them, but Profs. Hollenhorst and Landis opened their article with the observation that their university, Western Washington University, is named indirectly after a slave owner: George Washington. If I wanted to be catty myself, I would add that Prof. Rupke’s university, Washington and Lee University, is named after both Washington and the famous defender of slavery, Robert E. Lee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cattiness aside, I would like to let Profs. Hollenhorst and Landis get the last word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The distinguished historians WWU asked to look at the issue overwhelmingly concluded the claims just don’t hold up. Huxley’s early writings did reflect the prevailing bigotry and prejudice of Victorian society, although even then to a lesser degree than his scientific peers. By the 1860s, he became a vocal abolitionist and by the end of his life called for universal equal rights regardless of race or gender. The beautiful irony of his scientific work on human diversity is [that] it ultimately leads him to see the oneness, and equality, of all humanity. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, further,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Huxley later expanded these ideas in his great battles against social Darwinism and religion, which he saw as grounded in the dark forces of authority, bigotry and superstition. He feared they led to social order based on competition, subjugation and inequality. In this he was prescient, for indeed both have been used to justify not only laissez-faire capitalism and political conservatism, but also colonialism, eugenics, racism and eventually fascism. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s telling he didn’t teach at Cambridge or Oxford, but rather working-class institutions, the Royal School of Mines and later Imperial College, where he brought science and industry together to solve societal problems. He gave hundreds of free public lectures to common folk. As an early advocate for public education, he was elected to the London School Board, where he worked to bring a decent education to ordinary people and implemented the first training for science teachers. In other words, he’d make an exemplary WWU faculty member today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

What would Huxley say about his legacy? First, he’d commend us for interrogating it, especially the brave students, who without power and risking reproach, stood up to raise the issue. But he’d then remind them that “it is not what we believe, but why we believe it. Moral responsibility lies in diligently weighing the evidence.” And to all of us he’d likely say, “learn what is true in order to do what is right.” Now that the question is before us, address it with honesty and integrity. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, finally,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don’t be fooled. Huxley’s message isn’t privileged. It isn’t elitist. It isn’t racist. It’s timeless. The values he fought for are at the core of public higher education to this day. Far from causing harm, we are in a better place because of Thomas H. Huxley. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall add, finally, and not entirely parenthetically, that Profs. Hollenhorst and Landis trace the association between Huxley and social Darwinism to a notorious fabricator, Henry Morris, the founder of “scientific” creationism and himself something of a racist. It is partly because of this background that I fear that if Huxley is “cancelled,” then Darwin is next.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Autograph portrait of Professor Huxley before he &quot;returned to the use of his razor.&quot; From a notebook used by him about 1857 and evidently made to amuse his baby.

&lt;em&gt;(quote from EN&amp;amp;ST)&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Bad “Evolutionary” Habit&lt;/h3&gt;

Throughout these articles, one can see the writers inserting the adjective “evolutionary” in front of everything. 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen” — why not just a geneticist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “giraffes are a poster child for evolutionary oddities” — why not just oddities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “several phenotypic traits that share evolutionary constraints” — why not just constraints, as in engineering specifications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “This [reduction in olfactory sensitivity] may be an evolutionary consequence of enhanced vision” — why not just a consequence, as in a designed trade-off for multiple competing specifications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “evolutionary adaptations” — why not just adaptations, or unique traits fit for the giraffe’s ecological niche?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “evolutionary pleiotropy” — why not just pleiotropy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; “a suite of traits are changed within a short evolutionary time” — why not a suite of traits that work together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Typists could avoid carpal tunnel syndrome by eliminating this unnecessary word in science papers and news stories. 
It seems that the “evolutionary” biologists, who should just call themselves biologists, want to push a narrative
that everything in the living world must pay tribute to Darwin. The repetition of the word hammers it into people’s
heads. Everything in nature, they are taught with this propaganda tactic, is part of a fluid phantasmagoric 
tableau where every creature came from some other creature and is becoming something else. 
&lt;p&gt;

&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(end of quote from EN&amp;amp;ST)&lt;/em&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;
And here I had thought that the Discovery Institute was now OK with using the word &quot;evolution&quot;.  After all, they
have often explained, everything changes, and that is all that &quot;evolution&quot; means.  It is only when natural selection is invoked that
they become unable to acknowledge those changes.  And, it turns out, when common descent is inferred.  Their love affair with &quot;change&quot;
seems to always end there.
&lt;p&gt;
So now we seem to be back to an earlier era, when species were assumed to be fixed.  Even Young Earth Creationists seemed lately 
to have invoked extremely rapid evolution so as to turn the limited number of &quot;kinds&quot; that would fit on the Ark into all present-day species in a few hundred years.
But now the Discovery Institute announces that, whatever the amount of change, the word &quot;evolution&quot; is unhearable.
&lt;p&gt;
Well, I am an evolutionary biologist, because that's what I work on -- the processes of evolution and the history of life that results. 
And I guarantee you that evolutionary geneticists, evolutionary genomicists, evolutionary anthropologists, evolutionary physiologists, evolutionary developmental biologists,
and evolutionary molecular biologists are going to keep using that word, no matter how unhearable it is to the Discovery Institute. We will investigate
evolutionary rates, evolutionary correlations, evolutionary tradeoffs, and much more.
And there is no &quot;shrubbery&quot; that will change that.
