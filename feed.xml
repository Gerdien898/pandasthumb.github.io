&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  Are killer bat experiments by mad scientists only the stuff of B movies?
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although William Dembski is no longer a prominent figure in the Intelligent Design movement he helped found, he does remain among its proponents and occasionally writes about it on his blog.  A recent entry entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://billdembski.com/intelligent-design/how-to-cover-up-design-inferences/&quot;&gt;&quot;How to Cover Up a Design Inference: The Coronavirus as a Case Study&quot;&lt;/a&gt; draws some unexpected, and unintentionally revealing, connections between ID and the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;He begins with a brief summary of his ID argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(My) method took the form of an inference—specifically, an inference to the best explanation. Thus the method asserted that if an event, object, or structure conforms to an independently given pattern (i.e., a specification) and if in the absence of intelligence the probability of matching that pattern is small (i.e., improbability), then a design inference is warranted. Simply put, specified improbability constitutes a method for inferring design. Moreover, things that exhibit specified improbability are best explained as the product of intelligence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dembski then refers to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-science-suggests-a-wuhan-lab-leak-11622995184&quot;&gt;recent article in the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; by medical doctor Stephen Quay and physics professor Richard Muller supporting the belief that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, did not arise naturally in an animal host as most experts believe but, rather, was artificially engineered in a Chinese lab.  In support of this belief, they claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains the sequence CGG-CGG which “in the entire class of coronaviruses that includes CoV-2… has never been found naturally.”  However, according to them, it is commonly used in “gain of function” viral experiments in the laboratory.  Their conclusion is that the presence of this sequence demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 did not have a zoonotic origin but, instead, was created by human scientists.  Dembski's response to this argument is, “If this is not a full design inference in the sense of my Cambridge University Press monograph, it’s close.”  And while he does qualify his position by saying he is not a conspiracy theorist and has not studied this issue in depth, Dembski clearly considers the possibility that the Chinese manufactured the virus to be at least highly plausible.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he then goes beyond even that and suggests that the Chinese government may now be engaged in an elaborate cover up operation involving the artificial creation of even more viruses that resemble the transitional forms the would be expected to exist if the virus had arisen naturally.  These would then be used to infect bats and other animals.  (I must say, I have spent some time reading up on the COVID-19 lab leak theory, but have not encountered anyone else suggesting this further diabolical aspect of the alleged plot, in which pandemics are not only being caused in humans, but in bats and other innocent creatures.  The only source Dembski cites is a tweet from a former Fox News reporter who now runs a wine business.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does one respond to all this?  Well, to begin with this entire argument regarding the CGG-CGG sequence has been definitively debunked.  While it is true that this sequence is not found in any of the other known SARS-like coronaviruses, that is a cohort of only three.  Among coronaviruses as a whole the sequence is not at all uncommon.  Virologist Kristian Anderson, one of the scientists involved in identifying SARS-CoV-2 and sequencing its genome, has provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/beingwell/nobel-winning-virologist-eats-wuhan-crow-1709ba20ef7d&quot;&gt;a detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of how the virus shows no signs of having arisen through anything other than natural processes. So right out of the block, Dembski is just blowing someone else’s hot air without having bothered to verify whether the claims have any merit, something that would have only required that he take a few quick moments from his “day job as a businessman” to do a Google search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that aside, I do believe Dembski’s article reveals more than he intends about his particular take on ID.  His rather detached attitude to the question of the virus’s origin is curious given his self-proclaimed status as one of the world’s leading experts in detecting “design” in nature.  It would seem if he really believed his own promotional material, he would be volunteering his services and expertise to help answer a question that has been at the forefront of the single gravest issue facing humanity at this moment:  Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?  Surely Bill Dembski can delay his quest to become a cryptocurrency billionaire for just a few days while he helps save the human race, no?  Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark do it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same question applies to the ID movement as a whole.  It’s not as if they have not had anything to say about COVID-19.  But their previous efforts were primarily focused on &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefederalist.com/2020/05/14/trump-needs-to-recruit-a-medical-red-team-to-challenge-lockdown-manic-governors/&quot;&gt;reversing lockdowns and other public health measures&lt;/a&gt; that, they feared, would jeopardize Donald Trump’s re-election by harming the economy.  Almost a year ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/macroscope/did-intelligent-design-just-miss-its-corona-moment&quot;&gt;an article in American Scientist&lt;/a&gt; asked if ID had missed its “corona moment.” With the lab leak theory rearing its head yet again, that moment has returned, but ID is still missing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, if ID actually had anything of value to contribute to the detection of “design” in biology.  But, on the contrary, I believe Dembski’s article only serves to accentuate why ID fails even at the theoretical level.  As I have said, the argument that the virus’s double CGG sequence is evidence of design is unsound because it turns out this sequence exists in viruses that have evolved naturally.  However, the logic of the general argument itself is valid.  That is to say, if one &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; to identify sequences in the virus that do not occur in nature but which are commonly found in viruses that are manufactured in a lab, then that would indeed be strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 had been manufactured. And, I would argue, this is how we determine whether or not something is designed in all other cases.  We do not determine this through measuring &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.fred.net/tds/lab/papers/ev/dembski/specified.complexity.html&quot;&gt;“complex specified information”&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/review-michael-behes-darwins-black-box&quot;&gt;&quot;irreducible complexity&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, by employing an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/theftovertoil/theftovertoil.html&quot;&gt;“explanatory filter”&lt;/a&gt; nor through appeal to any of the other vapid buzz words devised by the ID movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, the question of whether something was designed is answered through empirically derived knowledge regarding which things arise through natural processes, and which only arise through being created by intelligent designers.  Since bacteria who possess flagella arise thru the natural process of reproduction, we do not conclude that the bacterial flagellum was designed.  But since the outboard motor of a boat is not something that arises in nature, but is only manufactured by human beings, we know that it was designed. Without this background knowledge (which is not at all difficult to obtain), there is nothing inherent in the objects themselves that betrays their origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ID proponents argue that one of the chief hallmarks of “design” is the impossibility of the existence of functional transitional forms between one functional system and another.  So it is very odd that Dembski does not indicate he believes there would be any difficulty whatsoever in creating a series of transitional viruses leading up to SARS-CoV-2.  It would appear that, as Dembski sees it, the project would only be limited by the mendacity and cunning of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one were to present this argument to Dembski or any other proponent of ID, of course, they would almost certainly reject it.  However, their actions speak louder than their words.  When an opportunity arises that seems tailor-made for the practical application of their “theories”, it does not even cross their mind to take it.  And that suggests to me that, deep down, even they realize their ideas are worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2021/DSC04337_Sekonic_Light_Meter_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Light meter&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Sekonic light meter designed to fit on accessory shoe for 35-mm camera. This is perhaps somewhat off-task, but I cannot find a date for the meter. The accessory shoe, soon to evolve into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_shoe&quot;&gt;hot shoe&lt;/a&gt;, was developed in the 1970's, so the meter probably predates 1970. The highest ASA (ISO) speed is 3200, so the meter probably cannot date as early as the 1940's or even 1950's (Kodak Royal X Pan came out around 1957 with an astronomical ASA daylight speed of 1250). The meter is worth about $30 US, used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the uninitiated, you set the ASA speed by rotating the inner ring. In this case the ASA speed is 80. The meter reads &quot;3,&quot; so rotate the outer ring till the tick is opposite the &lt;i&gt;red&lt;/i&gt; 3. Then read the exposure &amp;ndash; for example, F/11 and 1/100&amp;nbsp;s. Now set your camera accordingly and take the picture. If your camera uses exposure values (EV), then use the number next to the black ASA speed (the black and red numbers are used to avoid crowding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The meter is photovoltaic, which means that (a) it is not as sensitive as a battery-powered photoconductive meter, but (b) it still works. You may convert the meter to an incident-light meter by opening the little door on the upper edge of the case.

&lt;p&gt;The 13th annual Panda’s Thumb Photography Contest begins now, Monday, June 21, at 12:00 p.m., MDT (MDT = UTC(GMT) – 6 h). Entries will be accepted between now and Wednesday, July 7, at 12:00 p.m., MDT. The rules are precisely the same as &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/06/photography-contest-xii.html&quot;&gt;last year’s&lt;/a&gt;, except, obviously, that the dates have been updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage entries in a single, general category, which includes pictures of just about anything of scientific interest: any object of experimentation or observation, from single-celled organisms, through nematodes, fruit flies, rats, chimpanzees, and college sophomores to volcanoes, stars, and galaxies. In order not to omit theoreticians, we will consider computer-generated pictures and also photographs of equipment. Photomicrographs and electron micrographs are likewise welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since rumor has it that the pandemic encouraged macro photography, we may, if we receive enough entries, establish a “macro” category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner and the runner-up will receive a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534976/improbable-destinies-by-jonathan-b-losos/&quot;&gt;Improbable Destinies&lt;/a&gt; by Jonathan Losos, generously donated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.com/&quot;&gt;National Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;, and a copy of one of my own books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we get enough entries, consistently with Rules 11 and 12, we may add categories and award additional prizes, presuming, of course, that we can find more prizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules of the contest are simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will consider any photograph that displays scientific interest – biological, paleontological, geological, or astronomical, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Submit photographs in JPEG format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reduce photographs to an information content of 600 pixels horizontally. If creationists require a definition of information, they may apply in writing to the management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Photographs may be enhanced but may not be montages. High dynamic range photographs are, however, accepted. Submit a maximum of 3 photographs (or 5 photographs per family) to thousandwords@pandasthumb.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Submit the photographs as attachments to an e-mail (not embedded in the body of the e-mail). The subject line to the e-mail must have the form YourLastName_PhotographyContest. The filenames for the photographs must have the form YourLastName_Descriptor as, for example, Young_Oxytropis_sericea or Young_Table_Mountain, as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In your e-mail, identify the subject of the photograph: common and biological name, mineral type, or geological formation, for example. Provide a link that will allow a reader to learn more about the subject. You may add descriptive text in the body of the e-mail if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Depending on the number of photographs submitted, we may post the best submissions and ask our readers to vote for the best photograph. Likewise, we may establish several categories with separate entries and separate ballots. In particular, students 16 and under should so identify themselves; if we receive enough entries, we will establish a student category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By submitting a photograph, you stipulate that you are the owner of the copyright and grant The Panda’s Thumb a nonexclusive license to publish the photograph on its blog. The photograph will be subject to a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivatives license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regular contributors to The Panda’s Thumb are not eligible to enter the contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The decision of the judges is irrevocable. The judges remain irrepressibly and irreducibly irascible, irreverent, and irredeemable, irregardless and irrespective, but not, we hope, irrational or irritable. We hope for a veritable irruption of entries this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even though we are getting fairly good at running contests, we reserve the right to change any of the rules, or add or subtract rules at any time at our discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will choose a number of finalists and open voting for the winner at 12:00 p.m., Monday, July 12. Voting will end Friday, July 23, at 12:00 noon, and the winner will be announced om Monday, July 26, at 12:00.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Sekonic light meter designed to fit on accessory shoe for 35-mm camera.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2021/JTBHBG2021.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;JTB IDcreationist paper&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They never give any evidence that any known complex adaptation had to evolve through their imaginary scenario, so the relevance of their paper to real biology is only that, imaginary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the paper does sort of casually mention by name a number of complex adaptations that evolved in a (geologically speaking) short amount of time, Hössjer et al. never give any evidence that any of these adaptations actually evolved or &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to evolve through their imaginary scenario. Only this short section of the paper is what appears to try to connect their hypothetical scenario to the real world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For more complex adaptations of a species, it is necessary that several genes are modified in a &lt;em&gt;coordinated&lt;/em&gt; manner, either through mutations in the coding sequence, or through changed expression of these &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; genes. For instance, the fossil record is often interpreted as having long periods of stasis (Voje et al., 2018), interrupted by more abrupt changes and “explosive” origins (Bechly and Meyer, 2017). These changes include, for instance, the evolution of life (Bell et al., 2015), photosynthesis (Hecht, 2013), multicellularity and the “Avalon Explosion” (Shen et al., 2008), animal body plans and the “Cambrian Explosion” (Erwin and Valentine, 2013), complex eyes (Paterson et al., 2011), vertebrate jaws and teeth (Fraser et al., 2010), terrestrialization (e.g., in vascular plants, arthropods, and tetrapods) (Bateman et al., 1998), insect metamorphosis (Labandeira, 2011), animal flight and feathers (Wu et al., 2018, Yang et al., 2019), reproductive systems, including angiosperm flowers, amniote eggs, and the mammalian placenta (Chuong, 2013, Doyle, 2012, Roberts et al., 2016, Sauquet, 2017, Specht and Bartlett, 2009), echolocation in whales (Churchill et al., 2016, Park et al., 2016) and bats (Simmons et al., 2008), and even cognitive skills of modern man (Neubauer et al., 2018). Based on radiometric dating of the available windows of time in the fossil record, these genetic changes are believed to have happened very quickly on a macroevolutionary timescale. In order to evaluate the chances for a neo-Darwinian process to bring about such major phenotypic changes, it is important to give rough but reasonable estimates of the time it would take for a population to evolve so that the required multiple genetic changes occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we read carefully with comprehension we see that none of these references even remotely indicate that the complex adaptations listed would have to evolve through the scenario Hössjer et al. go on to model. 
They start by simply asserting (my bold) that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For more complex adaptations of a species, &lt;strong&gt;it is necessary&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;em&gt;several genes&lt;/em&gt; are modified in a &lt;em&gt;coordinated&lt;/em&gt; manner, either through mutations in the coding sequence, or through changed expression of these &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give no reference to substantiate that it is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for any of their following list of complex adaptations to have evolved with &lt;em&gt;“multiple genes”&lt;/em&gt; being modified in a &lt;em&gt;coordinated manner&lt;/em&gt; like the one they model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really all one needs to say about this paper with respect to its relevance to real biology. It’s a typical example of GIGO, where the conclusion you derive from your calculation is entirely dictated by the reality of the assumptions you base them on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also another example of creationist papers focused on so-called “waiting time problems” with evolution, which are typically based on the entirely imaginary - and totally dubious premise - that there are “target sequences” that evolution must find and evolve towards without any input by natural selection, by mutating incrementally from some random ancestral sequence until the correct (or almost correct) “target” sequence is produced by the chance accumulation of mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To nobody’s surprise, the longer the target sequence is, the longer it will take before chance mutations happen to produce it or something very near to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for creationists, this imaginary scenario has next to nothing to do with how potential new genes gain regulatory promoter sequences. In real biology the background low-level affinities between DNA binding proteins and DNA sequences ensures that there’s almost always &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; activity for selection to act on to improve the binding between a transcription factor and a promoter sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than try to calculate the probability of evolving this interaction with “targets” that have to match near-perfectly - from some random ancestor - with zero real chemical or biophysical input, biochemists have done even better and experimentally evolved promoters in the lab.  It turns out this is surprisingly easy for evolution. In an experiment with E coli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04026-w&quot;&gt;(Yona et al. 2018)&lt;/a&gt; approximately &lt;strong&gt;~60%&lt;/strong&gt; of random DNA sequences are &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; mutation away from turning into a selectively useful transcriptional promoter, and &lt;strong&gt;~10%&lt;/strong&gt; of random DNA sequences are functional promoters just by chance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random sequences rapidly evolve into de novo promoters&lt;/strong&gt;
Avihu H. Yona, Eric J Alm &amp;amp; Jeff Gore&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;
How new functions arise de novo is a fundamental question in evolution. We studied de novo evolution of promoters in Escherichia coli by replacing the lac promoter with various random sequences of the same size (~100 bp) and evolving the cells in the presence of lactose. We find that ~60% of random sequences can evolve expression comparable to the wild-type with only one mutation, and that ~10% of random sequences can serve as active promoters even without evolution. Such a short mutational distance between random sequences and active promoters may improve the evolvability, yet may also lead to accidental promoters inside genes that interfere with normal expression. Indeed, our bioinformatic analyses indicate that E. coli was under selection to reduce accidental promoters inside genes by avoiding promoter-like sequences. We suggest that a low threshold for functionality balanced by selection against undesired targets can increase the evolvability by making new beneficial features more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

Ms. Reid notes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;even though the overwhelming likelihood remains that SARS-CoV-2 evolved naturally, the accidental-escape theory hasn’t been ruled out. Still, there are a lot of reasons why that scenario is unlikely. Foremost among them, to my mind, is that it’s hard to imagine how a wild bat virus could evolve the ability to be both infectious to humans and transmissible between humans in a highly controlled laboratory environment, even admitting the possibility of occasional safety lapses (which have so far only been rumored, not proven). Remember, the most closely related bat virus — which cannot infect humans — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0771-4&quot;&gt;differs at over 1,200 nucleotides&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, making a good-faith effort to rule out that possibility is important, and that is why a group of prominent scientists recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1&quot;&gt;called for a new investigation&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that an earlier one was not as thorough as it should have been.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Reid gives short shrift to the “theory” that the virus was released deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controversy may have begun in earnest on May 5, when the science journalist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Wade&quot;&gt;Nicholas Wade&lt;/a&gt; in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists asked, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/2021/05/the-origin-of-covid-did-people-or-nature-open-pandoras-box-at-wuhan/&quot;&gt;Did people or nature open Pandora’s box at Wuhan?&lt;/a&gt; Mr. Wade is a former reporter for Science and the New York Times, and holds a bachelor of arts degree in natural sciences. He has written an interesting article, but in the end he blames “Trump Derangement Syndrome” (my characterization, not his) for scientists’ unwillingness to consider the lab-leak hypothesis. Whatever the merits of his article, he begins his conclusion with these loaded sentences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; If the case that SARS2 originated in a lab is so substantial, why isn’t this more widely known? As may now be obvious, there are many people who have reason not to talk about it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy “theory” continues, blaming scientists, for example, for failure to rock the boat and risk their funding. Mr. Wade’s article finally concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; The common sense perception that a pandemic breaking out in Wuhan might have something to do with a Wuhan lab cooking up novel viruses of maximal danger in unsafe conditions could eventually displace the ideological insistence that whatever Trump said can’t be true. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, apparently on the strength of Mr. Wade’s article, the Bulletin plans a &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebulletin.org/events/&quot;&gt; virtual program &lt;/a&gt; to discuss Mr. Wade’s “groundbreaking article,” featuring Mr. Wade himself, Bulletin editor-in-chief John Mecklin, and Bulletin president and CEO Rachel Bronson. And not an epidemiologist or virologist in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 14, David Relman of Stanford and 17 colleagues published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/694.1&quot;&gt;letter to the editor&lt;/a&gt; of Science magazine; Dr. Relman and his colleagues are the “group of prominent scientists” to whom Ms. Reid refers. The authors are all biologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, and so on. They say, primarily, that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA73/A73_R1-en.pdf&quot;&gt;report by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; did not give sufficient consideration to the possibility of an accident or a leak from the virology laboratory and should not have concluded so firmly that “a zoonotic spillover from an intermediate host as ‘likely to very likely,’ and a laboratory incident as ‘extremely unlikely.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to cherry-pick, but, as if to emphasize the political rather than the scientific, an article in Nature on May 27, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01383-3&quot;&gt;Divisive COVID ‘lab leak’ debate prompts dire warnings from researchers&lt;/a&gt;, quoted Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan as criticizing Dr. Relman and his colleagues for not considering “how [their article] would feed into the divisive political environment surrounding this issue.” Dr. Rasmussen added, “This debate has moved so far from the evidence that I don’t know if we can dial it back.” Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my head began to spin and my eyes lost their ability to focus on my monitor, I read a June 2 Washington Post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-bats-china-wuhan/2021/06/02/772ef984-beb2-11eb-922a-c40c9774bc48_story.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; which, though largely a profile of a Chinese researcher, mentioned a very curious hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The report lent credence to China’s preferred theory that the virus could have come from overseas, possibly via frozen food imports — though Beijing has presented little support for that. On the question of a possible lab leak, the report concluded that pathway was “extremely unlikely.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not quite a conspiracy theory, but &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of conspiracies, I read a May 31 post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-origin-of-sars-cov-2-revisited/&quot;&gt;The origin of SARS-CoV-2, revisited&lt;/a&gt;, by the well known skeptic and medical doctor David Gorski. Dr. Gorski reminds us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]henever there is a major outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic of infectious disease, one conspiracy theory always—and I do mean always—arises. That conspiracy theory is that the causative microbe was developed in a laboratory and/or escaped a laboratory. HIV, H1N1, the original SARS, Ebola virus, every single one of them gave birth to such conspiracy theories. Unsurprisingly, given its global scope and death toll, so it was with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gorski article is long, and I cannot go into detail. He points out something, however, that ought to be obvious but apparently is not: &lt;i&gt;The fact that there are two hypotheses does not mean that they are equally probable.&lt;/i&gt; Thus, he concludes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The natural origin hypothesis tends to [be] the default for any new disease that arises for the simple reason that it is by far the most likely to be the correct explanation. It’s very common for viruses to mutate and evolve in animals and then jump over to humans and pandemics have been caused this way before. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biologist Jerry Coyne also weighed in on June 4, in a blog post entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/06/04/did-the-covid-19-virus-come-from-a-wuhan-lab-its-looking-increasingly-likely/&quot;&gt;Did the Covid-19 virus come from a Wuhan lab? It’s looking increasingly likely&lt;/a&gt;. By “it,” Dr. Coyne means an accidental release. He refers here to a Newsweek article, which I have not read; he writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a group of amateurs, following the lead of an (sic) young Indian called “The Seeker,” who determined that the sequence of the pandemic virus was almost identical to that of the virus stored in the WIV (they managed to get the latter sequence), and that that virus was likely the one who killed the three men nine years ago. They also found out, through diligent labor, that the WIV was actually studying the virus despite their denial, and had made seven trips to the guano mine to collect samples. The amateurs found grant proposals from the WIV, which was apparently testing the infectivity of the collected viruses, possibly with the hope of producing a vaccine against them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mildly skeptical of something put forward by a “group of amateurs,” and I mention this blog post largely because the comments were instructive, and some of these criticized aspects of Dr. Gorski’s article. A commenter, Douglas Healy, claimed, correctly, I think, “When you mix politics with science, what you get is politics.” The conclusion to Mr. Wade’s article certainly lends support to Mr. Healy’s hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me? I am not a biologist, only a fellow traveler. I found Ms. Reid’s advice not to jump the gun to be compelling, and I thought that Dr. Gorski’s observations about the number of failed conspiracy theories were right on target. Until I unearth further evidence, I shall consider “natural source” to be the odds-on favorite.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">In a dispassionate look at the Covid pandemic, on May 28, Ann Reid of the National Center for Science Education warns us not to jump the gun and assume that the pandemic was caused by a leak from the laboratory of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appears the Biologic Institute [An enterprise of the Discovery Institute] is history, green screen and all. On their 2019 990, Director Axe will no longer draw a salary, but will be a prof at Biola “Univ.” Office space is for rent. Location is listed as “permanently closed.” Their final 990 showed a loss of $133,000. [Emendation in original.] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked Guidestar for their latest IRS Form 990-EZ, which is dated 2019 and covers the fiscal year 2018 (Charity Navigator is a year behind). Sure enough, it contains the following statement on line 28:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;DR. AXE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH BIOLA UNIVERSITY TO SERVE AS THE MAXWELL VISITING PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY DURING THE 2018/2019 ACADEMIC YEAR, WITH REGULAR VISITS TO CAMPUS. IN AUGUST 2019, DR. AXE BECAME THE MAXWELL PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AT BIOLA, WORKING FULL TIME ON TEACHING AND WORKING TO HELP BUILD A COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT AT BIOLA THAT INCLUDES ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. ALTHOUGH HE NO LONGER DRAWS A SALARY FROM BIOLOGIC INSTITUTE, DR. AXE CONTINUES TO SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR AND IS EXPLORING WAYS IN WHICH BIOLOGIC CAN PARTNER WITH BIOLA. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Dr. Axe” in question is Douglas Axe, the president of the Biologic Institute. His salary of $133,333 in 2018 was the bulk of the total expenses of $201,873. Revenue was $68,600, leaving a deficit almost exactly equal to Dr. Axe’s salary. Inasmuch as Dr. Axe “no longer draws a salary from Biologic Institute,” it seems safe to say that they are effectively out of business, even though he “is exploring ways in which Biologic can partner with Biola.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not very familiar with Biologic Institute, and reading a 2019 Form 990-EZ seems almost like reading ancient history, or at least medieval history, so I took a look at their website. The home page displays an undated article that was reposted from a 2017 article, followed by another article dated 2018. Medieval history indeed! Undiscouraged, I checked a tab labeled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biologicinstitute.org/research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;. After a long discussion of motivation, “core ideas,” and research areas, they list their publications. I will let other people discuss the content of the publications and will note only that the most recent is from 2014. Thus, unless the web page has simply been ignored, there has been little or no activity at the Biologic Institute since 2013 or 2014 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Biologic Institute is not dead, it has surely been moribund for the better part of the last decade. Where, I wonder, is their vaunted research program now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADDED 6:30 p.m., 05/23/2021:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A colleague sent me &lt;a href=&quot;https://ccfs.sos.wa.gov/#/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, whence I scrolled down to “Charity … Search” and entered “Biologic Institute.” I quickly found the following, which suggests that they ceased operations on 09/30/2019 with a balance of $9285, which precisely matches the amount on the last Form 990_EZ that I could find.&lt;/p&gt;
