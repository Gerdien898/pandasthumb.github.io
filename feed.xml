&lt;p&gt;An alert reader (who must subscribe to every newspaper on the planet) alerted us to this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/ulster-museum-could-end-up-in-court-over-freedom-of-information-request-41926500.html&quot;&gt;Ulster Museum could end up in court over stance on evolution&lt;/a&gt;, by Ciaran O’Neill in the Belfast (Northern Ireland) Telegraph. It is not clear that the Ulster Museum will end up in court, but the fact is that an unnamed citizen submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for “‘empirical evidence and hard science’ used to support the museum’s ‘endorsement of the origins of the human species,’” according to the Telegraph article. Instead of, as a colleague put it, giving the person a link to the Smithsonian, the Museum evidently elected to ignore the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, it turns out, has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/complaints/&quot;&gt;Information Commissioner&lt;/a&gt;, and the citizen complained to the Commission. Without going into detail, the commission gave the museum 20 days, then, after a hearing, an additional 35 days to respond to the FOI request. So far, the museum has been silent. They could be held in contempt of court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the request is overbroad, asking for “e-mails, letters, notes and references, … &lt;i&gt;in paper format&lt;/i&gt;,” and I do not understand why the museum has not responded. By making an issue of this frankly nonsensical request, they may encourage other creationists to harass other museums.

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Chekhov(L) and Tolstoy(R).  Were they discussing the origin of the book?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article at the Discovery Institute’s
website Evolution News &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/08/from-intelligent-cause-to-intelligent-design-my-debt-to-charles-thaxton/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reprints a tribute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
that Stephen Meyer paid to Charles Thaxton,
in a preface Meyer wrote to a memoir
by Thaxton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During a session on the origin of life, the scientists 
discussed a question I had never considered: 
Where did the information stored in the DNA molecule 
come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On February 10, 1985, I learned I wasn’t the only one. On 
that day I found myself sitting in front of 
eight world-class scientists, who were 
discussing the vexing scientific and 
philosophical question: How did the first life on earth arise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, different question!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “information stored in the DNA molecule” is of course the precise sequence of bases.  Not the existence of the molecule
in the first place.  And there are well-known evolutionary processes that are capable of putting adaptive information into
the molecule by choosing particular bases at each site.  They continue to happen long after the origin of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very much like someone saying that to explain the information stored in some computer memory, what we have to discuss
is how the computer came to exist.  No, we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we compare a novel by Leo Tolstoy to a set of short stories by Anton Chekhov, what is of interest is not how books
came to be invented, or how the particular binding, fonts, and physical format were chosen.  The two works might be
very much the same in those respects, but they of course will be very different in the sequence of letters in the
books.  And that is where the information is that makes them different, and makes both of them remarkable.  In the
photo above we see Chekhov(L) with Tolstoy(R), when Tolstoy visited Chekhov’s dacha in 1900.  The two authors 
had much to discuss about their writings, and those of others.  But I doubt they spent much of that time discussing 
how and where books first arose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of Meyer’s piece concentrates on the origin of life, and does not at all discuss how the information in the 
DNA got there.  Why does Meyer insist on describing that as the issue? Is there some big mystery?  Are the ordinary processes of evolution, such as natural selection and 
mutation somehow incapable, in principle, of putting into the DNA information that leads to the organism being well-adapted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in the sequences in DNA (or RNA) genomes can lead to differences in phenotype.  And those differences in 
phenotype can lead to differences in function, and thus differences in fitness.  The sequences with higher fitness will 
tend to increase in frequency.  The genotypes in the population come to be better adapted.  When we use the scale of 
fitness as a specification, the functional information in the genome then increases.  There is no mystery as to how 
this can happen, no proof that improved adaptation is somehow impossible in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misunderstanding-or-misdirection&quot;&gt;Misunderstanding or misdirection?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates of ID and creationists often avoid talking about how changes of DNA sequence by mutation and by changes of 
gene frequency of the resulting DNA sequences increase the functional information in the DNA.  They usually immediately 
change the subject to the Origin Of Life.  I like to call this change of topic OTOOL (Off To the Origin Of Life), or
STOOL (Switch To the Origin Of Life).  It is moving to a much-less-well-understood topic, one where Design Intervention 
can be invoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They often say that they do not question the processes of “microevolution”, including mutation, natural selection, 
gene flow, and genetic drift.  Yet these processes can easily be shown to put functional information into the pool of 
genomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what Stephen Meyer does in the Preface to Thaxton’s book, the one quoted in his piece in Evolution News.  It’s the 
old switcheroo once again.  When Meyer raises the issue of how the information comes to be in the DNA, he immediately does the
old familiar change-of-topic.  If he does not mean to deliberately switch the topic, then he is giving a strong indication 
that he simply does not understand what the functional information in DNA is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-the-echo-chamber&quot;&gt;In the echo chamber&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as usual,
at Uncommon Descent, the Meyer/Thaxton article is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-evolution-news-from-intelligent-cause-to-intelligent-design-my-debt-to-charles-thaxton/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taken very seriously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and quoted at length, with no
recognition that the origin of the information in
the DNA might be a different issue from the origin of the first DNA molecule.  The post is authored by “Caspian”, who the
site identifies as its regular poster, physicist Eric Hedin.  He ought to have a good grasp of
information theory.  Is it too much 
to ask whether the site might someday distinguish between these two questions?  Apparently so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Chekhov(L) and Tolstoy(R). Were they discussing the origin of the book?

The format is essentially that Prof. Myers plays a bit of the Chaffey video, then pauses and – I was going to say they dissect it, but demolish may be the better word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original video is rather odd: it appears to have been speeded up, and all the pauses have been eliminated. It is as if they want to get through their arguments so fast that you cannot understand or refute them.

&lt;p&gt;I have not finished watching the video yet, but one thing that caught my attention was this: Mr. Chaffey is at pains to demonstrate that the Ark was big enough to hold all the “kinds” necessary. Apart from his risible contention that sea creatures needed no saving from a flood that could carve the Grand Canyon, Mr. Chaffey seems to think that the Ark had enough space to house the necessary land creatures. In rebuttal, Prof. Myers cleverly looked up the land areas and numbers of species of several zoos, not to mention the number of employees. Suffice to say that the zoos occupied more area than the Ark and had more employees than Noah and his family. (Yes, I know, the zoos need room for visitors. Fine, cut the area and the number of employees by 5 and compare that to the Ark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Meanwhile, the Ark Encounter continues to make major additions. On the third deck of the massive ship [sic], a large exhibit highlighting a giant plant fossil is now on display. This unique 10’7” palm frond fossil was discovered in the well-known Green River Formation of Wyoming. &lt;/p&gt;  
 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. Andrew Snelling, head of the research department at AiG, declared: 'It is a phenomenal, world-class fossil. It is not millions of years old. The palm frond was buried catastrophically as a result of the global flood of Noah’s day about 4,500 years ago.' A family in Wisconsin made the fossil’s donation possible.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The palm frond, we note, is in very good condition for something that was buried catastrophically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Green River Shale fossils are actually common and well-studied, so this display isn’t hurting scientific research as badly as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/06/will-aig-return.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allosaurus&lt;/i&gt; specimen they received from the neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka&lt;/a&gt;.  Magnificent specimens like these are very expensive. This one was probably prepared by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenriverstone.com/&quot;&gt;Green River Stone Company&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial excavator and preparation company that is concerned exclusively with making sales (one of many problems with the commercial fossil market; sales do not necessarily benefit scientific research).

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, I argued that modern-day critics of the Modern Evolutionary 
Synthesis who think that they are putting forth a Lamarckian theory most likely
aren’t doing that, as they do not actually believe that the direction of change 
toward adaptation comes from use and disuse of organs.  To Lamarck, the 
directionality was not due to external environmental effects being inherited, 
it was actually the effort made by the individual to use particular organs more or use them 
less that somehow altered its genetic makeup and it was those changes that were inherited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now comes Dennis Noble.  A leader of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis 
group and one of the main organizers of the notorious 2016 meeting on New Trends 
in Evolutionary Biology brought about by misguided biologists, philosophers, and
historians who talked the Royal Society into endorsing it, he has published 
another outburst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noble, an eminent physiologist, points to exosome vesicles that can cross the 
barrier between the somatic cells and the germ cells in animals, ones that can
contain mRNA.  These, he argues, can serve as the basis for the effects of use 
and disuse to alter the herditary material.  He does not actually show that this 
is what they do.  A critical issue is whether the effects on the somatic cells 
then induce in the germ cells a genetic change that is adaptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t listen to me.  Jerry Coyne has lost his temper and published a 
critique at his blog &lt;em&gt;Why Evolution Is True&lt;/em&gt;. He tears strips off Noble in a rather 
disrespectful way.  Which seems to me to be appropriate.  When Jerry gets into 
a high Evolutionary Synthesis dudgeon, he is well worth reading.  You will 
find his piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/08/07/denis-noble-goes-after-darwinian-evolution-again-scores-own-goal/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Organisms tried to solve their problems by using (or disusing) their organs, and the resulting changes would be adaptive and of course would be passed on to the next generation.  Lamarck also believed that,
in addition, there was an overall force in descent of organisms in nature leading to an increase of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Lamarckism dead now?  Well, yes and no.  Let me explain …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people who have evolutionary theories that they think are Lamarckian.  A prime example is Dr. Eva Jablonka, an evolutionary biologist at the Cohn Institute for the History of Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University. 
She declares herself a Lamarckian, invoking epigenetic changes of DNA as her mechanism (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Jablonka&quot;&gt;her Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that mean she believes that, in addition to the known physical laws, that there is an inherent complexifying force in nature?  I don’t think so.  And does she believe that use and disuse of organs, together with epigenetic inheritance, explains adaptations?  I can’t see that she does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She does identify her views as Lamarckian in her web page at the Third Way of Evolution website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thethirdwayofevolution.com/people/view/eva-jablonka&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  She is also a member of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis group (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://extendedevolutionarysynthesis.com/person/eva-jablonka/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  She has written many books, and you can easily find YouTube videos of lectures where she advocates views she calls Lamarckian. For a critical review of her arguments, see Bruce Walsh’s book review in volume 50, number 5, 1996 in &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03600.x&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside her main concerns, which are to vindicate the importance of epigenetic phenomena in evolution, and to place them in the context of other forms of non-Mendelian inheritance, we can ask whether Lamarck would recognize her views as his own.  I can’t see that he would.  “Lamarckian” evolutionary phenomena may be repeatedly invoked by a generation of skeptics of the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis.  But in their view evolutionary changes that involve epigenetic variations in populations come from natural selection acting on those variations.  By contrast, use and disuse is different: a kind of directed mutation.  Lamarck’s theory invoked, in effect, directed mutation, and did not depend on selecting among variations in the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamarck is being invoked against the Modern Synthesis.  But his theories of change are not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Happy birthday, Jean-Baptiste! On this day, August 1, in 1744 Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de Lamarck, was born. Had he lived he would now be a sprightly 278 years old.

A hoatzin in Peru (Kate from UK, CC BY-SA 2.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0&quot;&gt;via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/div&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismissals of evolutionary biology have come at such a pace lately that we need at least a monthly report on how the previous month’s evolutionary theory has been overthrown. I hope that this can 
be a regular feature.  I figure that once a month is about 
right, as there are enough overthrows of evolutionary theory to
supply it.  Well, actually I hope that there will be no
need for such a series, but alas …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month we report on two such events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hoatzin, a silly-looking bird that looks like a confused
chicken, is hard to place on the phylogeny of birds.  An 
article in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; suggests that this may discredit
the very notion of a phylogeny.  That in turn has led to comments
by many of the usual suspects.  One of the major scientific papers on
bird phylogeny has as an author our own John Harshman.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A survey of new discoveries in evolutionary biology appeared
in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.  Its author called for existing
evolutionary theory to be tossed out and for it to be replaced
by the thinking of the supporters of the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis.  The piece has been welcomed by creationists and
advocates of ID, and criticized by pro-evolution websites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Below the fold” you will find some more details and links.  Will
the new paradigms still be around a month from now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hoatzin-disproves-the-tree&quot;&gt;The hoatzin disproves the tree&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hoatzin, which looks like an exasperated chicken, seems to
have diverged from other birds early in the radiation of modern
birds.  The branches in the tree of life connecting it to their
ancestors are short, and long ago.  That is the situation in which 
we expect it to be difficult to place the hoatzin branch. But an
article in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; by Ben Crair
on July 15, 2022 comes
to a much more dramatic conclusion 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-bizarre-bird-thats-breaking-the-tree-of-life&quot;&gt;(you can find it here, perhaps behind a paywall)&lt;/a&gt;.
The hoatzin “is breaking the
tree of life”.  He mentions a number of phenomena, such as
discrepancies between “gene trees” (coalescents) and species
trees, as reasons that the genealogy of the hoatzin calls
into question the notion of phylogeny:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Darwin thought family trees could explain evolution. The hoatzin suggets otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crair’s dramatic piece has been noticed and commented on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jerry Coyne, at his site Why Evolution Is True &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/07/17/the-new-yorker-writes-about-the-hoatzin-implies-that-darwns-idea-of-evolutionary-trees-may-be-a-phantom/&quot;&gt;is upset at the New Yorker article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Discovery Institute’s “Evolution News” reporter David Klinghoffer &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/bizarre-bird-highlights-the-problem-of-biogeography/&quot;&gt;reacts to Jerry’s article&lt;/a&gt;.  It is less clear
whether Klinghoffer would accept any genealogical scheme for the
relationships of living organisms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here, in the previous thread on the photo of
the Greater Yellowlegs &lt;em&gt;Tringa melanoleuca&lt;/em&gt; there was
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/tringa-melanoleuca.html&quot;&gt;some discussion of the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; 
in the comments, after the troll “Data” linked to it there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;goodbye-to-the-evolutionary-synthesis-too&quot;&gt;Goodbye to the evolutionary synthesis too&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the hoatzin piece were not enough, the past month also saw
a piece in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; casually toss out the Modern
Synthesis.  Stephen Buranyi wrote
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jun/28/do-we-need-a-new-theory-of-evolution&quot;&gt;a deliberately provocate “long read” article&lt;/a&gt;
entitled “Do we need a new theory of evolution?”  His 
subheading text is more provocative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A new wave of scientists argues that mainstream evolutionary theory needs an urgent overhaul. Their opponents have dismissed them as misguided careerists – and the conflict may determine the future of biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the article promotes the views that their advocates have
labelled the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.  The EES was first
put forward by a group who have been called The Altenberg 16, who
met in 2008 in a meeting in Altenberg, Austria.  The meeting was
greeted with great joy by the Discovery Institute, and journalist 
Susan Mazur wrote a whole book about it: &lt;em&gt;The Altenberg 16: An
exposé of the evolution industry&lt;/em&gt;, which she published
&lt;em&gt;before the meeting had taken place&lt;/em&gt;.  It was followed in 2016
by a meeting on &lt;em&gt;New trends in evolutionary biology: biological,
philosophical, and social science perspectives&lt;/em&gt; sponsored by the Royal Society,
and involving some of the same people (though many of the
evolutionary biologists in the Royal Society were unhappy
about its endorsement of these views).  There has been much blog
traffic about these meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buranyi discusses many of the phenomena invoked by the
EES.  It is obvious that his suggested answer is “yes”,
in violation of Betteridge’s Law of Headlines.  There have
been many reactions to Buranyi’s article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolutionary biologists Brian Charlesworth, Deborah Charlesworth
and Jerry Coyne &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/05/evolutionary-biologists-are-ever-adapting-to-progress-in-science&quot;&gt;wrote a reply in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; expressing
their disagreement wth the article, concluding that it
“gives a misleading picture of contemporary evolutonary.
biology”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/07/06/our-rejected-letters-to-the-guardian-about-evolution/&quot;&gt;At his site Why Evolution Is True&lt;/a&gt;, Jerry Coyne
republished their article, also a letter by
evolutionary biologist Doug Futuyma that the Guardian
declined to publish, as well as a list of errors in
Buranyi’s article that Brian Charlesworth compiled.  In
addition he describes three other replies that the
Guardian did publish, which he is not impressed by.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At Larry Moran’s important blog Sandwalk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2022/07/do-we-need-new-theory-of-evolution.html&quot;&gt;he
posted on the Guardian article&lt;/a&gt;. His
view is that the current theory should be called Modern Evolutionary
Biology, and he is not happy with the EES folks.  He says
that Buranyi’s article is pretty good, if you ignore
its “unfortunate” first four paragraphs, which he quotes.
Some Panda’s Thumb regulars are among the commenters on Larry’s
article.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;P. Z. Myers discussed the Buranyi article at some length
&lt;a href=&quot;https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/06/28/not-impressed-by-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/&quot;&gt;at his blog, Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; in a post
entitled “Not impressed by the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis”.  He
and Jerry Coyne are in more agreement on that than either would
like to admit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Of course, Evolution News needed to have its say,
which it did more than once, in articles &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/donate-darwinism-for-a-tax-credit-evolutionists-admit-their-fields-failures/&quot;&gt;by David Klinghoffer&lt;/a&gt;
(“evolutionists admit their field’s failures …. full of scandalous admissions”),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;… and &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/darwin-and-the-ghost-of-lamarck/&quot;&gt;a mention&lt;/a&gt; in an article by philology, lterature, and
philosophy professor Neil Thomas about Darwin and Lamarck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have previously posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/uncommon-diversion.html&quot;&gt;here at PT&lt;/a&gt; on Uncommon
Descent’s invocation of Buranyi’s article when looking
forward to pro-ID rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cue creationist David Coppedge &lt;a href=&quot;https://crev.info/2022/07/darwin-sausage-factory-exposed/&quot;&gt;at Creation/Evolution Headlines&lt;/a&gt;.  The title, “Darwin Sausage Factory Exposed” and the summary “A look inside the sausage factory where Darwinism
is manufactured could leave a visitor retching” say all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my obviously-biased view, evolutionary biology has
already assimilated many of these phenomena, so that the
discussion is really just about whether or not to rename
the theory.  Renaming has the disadvantage that it may lead
most people to assume that the evolutionary processes that
they learned about in school, including mutation, natural
selection, genetic drift, and gene flow, have been discarded.
(The EES folks would say that the phenomena that they invoke
are not being paid enough attention, and so a renaming is
needed).&lt;/p&gt;
