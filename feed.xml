Herschel Walker, asked why there were still apes, if humans have evolved from apes.  This is a common silly creationist
talking point.  It is usually stated as the question “why are there still monkeys”.  There's really not much
reason to spend time refuting it; it reflects an elementary misunderstanding of what evolutionary biologists say
about human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what was more astonishing was how our knowledgeable and sophisticated press explained the matter to its readers.  Here are some
jaw-dropping explanations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CNN’s Editor-at-large Chris Cilizza explained
&lt;a href=&quot;https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/03/16/politics/herschel-walker-geogia-senate-candidate-evolution-apes/index.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
that “Humans and apes evolved from the same genetic ape ancestors, a species now long extinct. (It’s known as “common
descent.”) We did not, however, evolve directly from the current occupants of your local zoo. They are one branch of
descent from their ape ancestors. Humans are another.”  And he quotes an evolutionary biologist, Fabio Mendes, as
saying that “Humans and apes evolved from the same genetic ape ancestors, a species now long extinct. (It’s known as
“common descent.”) We did not, however, evolve directly from the current occupants of your local zoo. They are one
branch of descent from their ape ancestors. Humans are another.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The digital media report The Hill &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/media/598393-herschel-walker-asks-why-are-there-still-apes-in-discussion-about-evolution&quot;&gt;played it
safe&lt;/a&gt;, relying on PBS: “According to a PBS FAQ about evolution, “Humans
are more closely related to modern apes … but we didn’t evolve from apes, either. Humans share a common ancestor
with modern African apes. … Scientists believe this common ancestor existed 5 to 8 million years ago. Shortly
thereafter, the species diverged into two separate lineages. One of these lineages ultimately evolved into gorillas and
chimps, and the other evolved into early human ancestors called hominids.” (The PBS FAQ was actually from a 2001 science
program “Evolution”, a series funded by a foundation of Paul Allen’s.  It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat02.html&quot;&gt;can be found
here&lt;/a&gt;).  It in turn has links to some respectable sources,
some to the Talk.Origins site, which itself cites a couple of articles here at Panda’s Thumb.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A fact-checking site, Politifact, has its article
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/17/herschel-walker/yes-evolution-proves-humans-and-apes-can-coexist/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It is slightly more vague on the issue, but does say that “Humans and the apes known today both evolved from ancient apes, who are now extinct. This split occurred between 6-8 million years ago based on genetic and fossil evidence.  Over time, humans and apes have been evolving in their own ways to adapt in their respective environments.”
and also that “Humans and modern-day apes both evolved from ancient apes, who are now extinct. Anthropologists using
genetic and fossil evidence pinpoint it between 6-8 million years ago. Humans and the apes seen today evolved
differently over time.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message is clear.  Apes, who, us?  We evolved from something, but it wasn’t an ape.  Nosiree!  Apes evolved
separately from us, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not right&lt;/em&gt;, of course.  Which means we ought to discuss why so many people who know evolution happened can’t seem to
say that we evolved from apes, that in fact &lt;em&gt;we are apes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about this …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick summary of the situation might be to note that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;About 60 years ago it was still thought that the most recent common ancestor of humans and apes lived 25 million years
ago.  That would place most apes in a sister-group to humans.  It was thus possible to say that the common ancestor wasn’t
an ape.  This was much less upsetting to the public than saying that any of their ancestors had been apes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “evolutionary systematics” position on classification, which was dominant then, did not require groups in the
classification system to be monophyletic (to have their very own common ancestor).  Apes could be placed in one group,
humans in another, even though some of the descendants of the common ancestor of all apes included humans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By this point, biologists should have started admitting that humans were descended from apes.  They sort-of did,
though usually reassuring the public that they weren’t descended from any hairy and gross animal like &lt;em&gt;present-day&lt;/em&gt; apes such
as chimpanzees and gorillas.  This evades the question of whether any of our ancestors were hairy and gross.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But by the 1970s it was becoming clear that humans were in a clade that included chimps and gorillas.  And that our lineage
connected with apes less than 10 million years ago.  And monophyletic
classification (“phylogenetic systematics”) was becoming the dominant approach.  In the 1980s it became clear that the lineage with the two species of
chimpanzees was the sister lineage of hominids.  From that point on, it was inevitable that popular-science discussions
of human ancestry would finally admit that we had ancestors that &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; apes.  And that we ourselves were apes.
Jared Diamond was straightforward about that in his book &lt;em&gt;The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal&lt;/em&gt; in 1991.
But Francisco Ayala was more circumlocuitous in his 2010 book &lt;em&gt;Am I a Monkey? Six Big Questions about Evolution&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has taken an extraordinary amount of time for popular writings in biology to admit that you not only have an inner fish,
but an inner monkey and an inner ape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guest post by Dan Phelps. Mr. Phelps’s most recent contribution to PT was &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/11/your-brain-as-walnut.html&quot;&gt;Your Brain as a Walnut&lt;/a&gt; in November 2021. Matt Young will be the principal moderator of this thread.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using the Kentucky Open Records Act (KORA) for several years to keep up with attempts by creationists to infiltrate schools, receive tax incentives for the Ark Encounter theme park, and monitor attendance levels at the Ark Encounter. Usually, government entities have been cooperative with my efforts. The public, after all, should have the right to know how the government, at all levels, conducts its business. Alas, the Kentucky Attorney General has protected himself from public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 8, 2021, Kentucky Attorney General (AG) Daniel Cameron visited the Ark Encounter near Williamstown, Kentucky. On September 12, 2021, a brief, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kyoag/status/1437026455171575813&quot;&gt;professionally done video of his visit&lt;/a&gt; was posted to the Kentucky Attorney General’s official state Twitter page (this is not a political campaign site, but an official Commonwealth of Kentucky account for the AG’s Office). The video ends by displaying a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;link to the AG’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video shows that the AG and his entourage received a personal tour from Ken Ham, even viewing the quasi-spectacular vista on the upper deck where tourists generally are not allowed. Interestingly, there isn’t any audio of Cameron or Ham, just quick edit clips of Ham leading a tour set to music. It is difficult to imagine anything helpful or informative to Kentuckians about the video, and it appears to be nothing more the AG pandering to the most conservative Kentucky voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Cameron has been Kentucky’s Attorney General since 2019. He is the first Republican to hold the office since the 1940s and the first African American to hold the office, ever. For two years after receiving his law degree from the University of Louisville in 2011, he was a law clerk to US District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Judge Tatenhove is well-known for ruling in favor of Answers in Genesis (AiG) receiving $18.25 million in tax rebate incentives from the Commonwealth of Kentucky in the case of &lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/kentucky/kyedce/3:2015cv00013/77195/56/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ark Encounter LLC et al. vs Bob Stewart et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Later, Daniel Cameron served as a legal counsel to then Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky from 2015 to 2017. Cameron led legal efforts to see that numerous federal judges were confirmed during the Trump administration. After this, he worked for a Kentucky law firm before winning the race for AG in 2019. Controversies during his tenure as AG have included his handling of the grand jury during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Breonna_Taylor&quot;&gt;Breonna Taylor case&lt;/a&gt; (Breonna Taylor was an unarmed young African American woman killed when the Louisville police enforced a no-knock warrant). Cameron also has challenged emergency Covid mask mandates by Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. In early November 2021, he sued the Federal Government in an attempt to block the Biden Administration’s mandate that employees of federal contractors be vaccinated. In August 2020 Cameron spoke at the Republican National Convention. In September 2020, his name appeared on a list by then President Donald Trump as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/09/09/daniel-cameron-named-possible-supreme-court-nominee-donald-trump/5762899002/&quot;&gt;potential candidate for the US Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;. It is no secret in Kentucky political circles that he may be a future candidate for Governor of Kentucky, or a candidate to replace Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell when McConnell eventually retires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intrigued and disturbed by the Twitter video, which I failed to see until mid-October 2021, I filed a Kentucky Open Records Act (KORA) request with the Attorney General’s Office on October 20. I requested: (1) All electronic mail, messages, mail, or other correspondence between the Office of Kentucky Attorney General and Answers In Genesis, between January 1 and October 15, 2021; (2) Any receipts and other evidence of taxpayer funds expended on the visit to the Ark Encounter facility; (3) A list of attendees employed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in connection with the visit; (4) Any mileage logs, travel receipts, or other statements reflecting travel to or from the Ark Encounter; and finally (5) Any written material, or other documents provided to the Attorney General or other employees of the Commonwealth of Kentucky during or following the above-referenced visit. I had help drafting this letter and appeals from Tony Sammons, a retired local attorney, David MacMillan, a law school student, and Amye Bensenhaver of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked for all of the information above because I want to know the details of Answers in Genesis’s influence on Kentucky’s politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the AG’s Office asked for an extension, I eventually received an empty and broken-open envelope on November 9. After further communication, I finally received the KORA package electronically via Dropbox on November 12. This was more than 20 days after my initial request. To my surprise, I received only a copy of the video that was posted to Twitter and approximately 70 still photographs of Attorney General Cameron, his wife, and their entourage (presumably attorneys and security guards) getting the personal tour from Ken Ham. Particularly disturbing, and in an odd sense comical, were the photos of the AG with Ham standing in front of displays explaining why Noah took only baby dinosaurs on the Ark (Figure 1) and why anthropogenic climate change is wrong (Figure 2). AG Cameron also is on the top deck of the Ark with Ken Ham (Figure 3). There was also a photo that included Answers in Genesis’ attorney John Pence (Figure 4). That, along with random photos of other unnamed staff and security guards, was &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; I received. I wasn’t even given information as to the exact date of the event (info in the photo metadata tags indicates September 8, 2021). Interestingly, if the metadata on the photographs is correct, the KY AG’s entourage arrived at 10:45 am, but did not enter the Ark-shaped building until about 1:40 pm. This gave ample time for discussions between the Attorney General, Ken Ham, and their staffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I received nothing concerning how much tax money was expended on this propaganda. I again contacted the Open Records Officer at the Attorney General’s Office, thinking information had been mistakenly omitted. The AG’s Office explained it was withholding everything else that I requested. The KY AG’s Office claimed not to have records on who accompanied Daniel Cameron or any expenses related to the trip; not even mileage or fuel expenses. The AG’s Office admitted that three emails that initiated the event, but claimed that these were exempt from KORA. The excuse given for not providing the three emails was that records related to meetings and calendar invitations are exempt in a rather broad interpretation of a case about the Kentucky Open Records Act: &lt;a href=&quot;https://casetext.com/case/courier-journal-v-jones&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courier-Journal v. Jones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. KY AG’s Office has notoriously interpreted several court cases in odd ways as limiting open records requests. I decided to appeal the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Kentucky AG’s Office oversees all appeals to the Kentucky Open Records Act in Kentucky, unless one opts to go directly to Circuit Court. An attorney is essential to have a chance of success in Circuit Court. Thus, the appeal was ruled on by the &lt;em&gt;very agency&lt;/em&gt; involved in the complaint. My appeal was responded to by a political appointee from the KY AG’s Office, which was not surprising or improper. My appeal was ultimately rejected on the grounds that the information requested was broadly, and in my opinion inappropriately, interpreted to be part of the AG’s schedule and exempt from KORA because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ag.ky.gov/Resources/orom/2022/22-ORD-026.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courier-Journal v. Jones&lt;/em&gt; ruling mentioned above&lt;/a&gt;. Most remarkably, the rejection of my appeal was also written by a political appointee at the KY AG’s Office. At a minimum a Kentucky Merit System employee, who supposedly would not be subject to political pressure, should have written the final decision. I was given 30 days to appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filing an appeal to the KY AG’s decision in Circuit Court would require more complex legal skills than I am capable of (I’m a geologist with a background in paleontology/paleoecology.) An appeal without legal counsel had the prospect of me arguing the case in circuit court.* It also would require considerable money unless an attorney would accept the case &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;/em&gt;. I attempted for some time to get the ACLU and local attorneys to help. Unfortunately, every attorney I contacted had too many &lt;em&gt;pro bon&lt;/em&gt;o cases already in litigation. Sadly, no one representing the ACLU even bothered to contact me. Thus, the deadline to appeal passed on March 16, 2022. Perhaps others with legal resources can request the three emails between the Kentucky Attorney General and Ken Ham/AiG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most plausible explanation for the AG visiting the Ark Park was that he was playing to his political base and affirming that he supported ultraconservative Christians. In all probability this visit was merely an attempt by Daniel Cameron to get support for his future political ambitions. Given the lengthy time span between arrival and touring the Ark, were other things done during the trip? The three emails I was denied could have clarified the trip’s full purpose. Was this meeting to get additional financial support or new tourism tax incentives for AiG’s building of a Tower of Babel “replica” on the Ark property? Does Ken Ham want the AG to support teaching creationism in Kentucky public schools? Or does this have something to do with AiG’s opposition to mask and vaccine mandates, which Daniel Cameron has also vigorously worked against? These questions are necessary because of the importance of science education, public health, the separation of church and state, financial integrity in the use of taxpayer’s money by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and how public servants use their time when they are supposed to be doing their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the transparency of a useful government open records policy, we may never know the answers. At the very least, the refusal to supply the information I requested is antithetical to the reasons open records laws were created in the first place. “Democracy Dies in Darkness” is the official slogan of the Washington Post. The adage applies not only to the media investigating the government, but citizens of all stripes with concerns about government activity. All parts of the political spectrum should support open records and government transparency. Since newspapers, which have large budgets for legal representation are shrinking, how are local advocates and activists such as I to receive information from an increasingly evasive and secretive government? Ordinary citizens concerned about government activities increasingly have less access to information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is a recording of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meXtkoVnI_g&quot;&gt; discussion&lt;/a&gt; that took place February 9 and was posted to YouTube, I think, around March 16. I mention it in case anyone else tried to watch the live broadcast; the sound quality of the live broadcast was so poor that I had to bail out. I finally got an opportunity to watch the recording yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to business: The discussion was not exactly a discussion; it was not exactly about human origins; and “Christian” seems to have been defined more or less to mean “evangelical Christian.” That said, it was an interesting discussion, lasting about an hour and a quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protagonists were Nathan Lents, Professor of Biology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, representing atheism, and Joshua Swamidass, Associate Professor of Immunology and Pathology at Washington University in St. Louis, representing evangelical Christianity. Professor Lents is the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Human-Errors-Panorama-Glitches-Pointless-ebook/dp/B07432D5GB/&quot;&gt;Human Errors: A Panorama of Our Glitches, from Pointless Bones to Broken Genes&lt;/a&gt;. Professor Swamidass is the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V4TBL5Z&quot;&gt;The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science of Universal Ancestry&lt;/a&gt;, which I reviewed on Panda’s Thumb &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/01/genealogical-adam-eve.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confess that I was somewhat skeptical when I found that the discussion had been hosted by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veritas_Forum&quot;&gt;Veritas Forum&lt;/a&gt;, primarily, I suppose, because I am suspicious of anyone who thinks they know the truth. They have, however, hosted speakers such as  Peter Singer, Steven Pinker, Antony Flew,  and Christopher Hitchens, so I persevered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professors Lents went first and devoted his 15 minutes to the proposition that scientists who study evolution have a “bazillion” lines of evidence, not just a few fossils. Indeed, there is a nearly perfect consensus that evolution happens, as opposed to debate as to how it happens. Humans have played by the same rules as any other animals. I won’t go into detail, but Prof. Lents adduced evidence from anatomy (homology, vestigial structures, and suboptimal design), biochemistry, and archaeology (evolution of stone tools, for example). Alas, he ran out of time precisely as he was about to discuss genetic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Swamidass took his 15 minutes next. Though he is a computational biologist, he was raised as a young-earth creationist, believing that the earth was around 6000 years old, God created everything from scratch, and evolution is not true. He eventually came to recognize three things, roughly chronologically and over an extended period: (1) Human evolution fits with scripture. Importantly, he seems to think that scripture must take precedence, and scripture and science must be fitted together, though I think that assumption was not stated explicitly. (2) The arguments against evolution are very shallow. (3) The real challenge is human evolution. Eventually, however, Prof. Swamidass came to believe that Adam and Eve were two people created without parents, less than 10,000 years ago, and they were the ancestors of everyone – yet we have a common ancestor with the great apes. Can it all be true? Professor Swamidass thinks it can, and some of his evidence is detailed in the review in Panda’s Thumb linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the presentations, Jeremy Purvis, Associate Professor of Genetics at University of North Carolina School of Medicine, moderated a brief discussion. I will mention a few highlights and let you watch it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professors Swamidass and Lents, interestingly, met when they were both attacked by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_Institute&quot;&gt;Discovery Institute&lt;/a&gt; after having published their books. They have since become fast friends, as was made evident by the tenor of the discussion. As Prof. Lents noted, there is no such thing as bad publicity, and I wish someone would attack one of my books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moderator asked whether there are any questions that only science can answer and questions that only scripture can answer? I thought it would have been more fair to substitute “religion” or maybe even “philosophy” for “scripture.” The two speakers agreed to the somewhat anodyne proposition that there are lots of important questions that are beyond science. Professor Lents, however, added that we all have similar values, and we should stop fighting over evolution vs. creation. Indeed, he thinks he learns more by talking with people he disagrees with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other questions involved the flood, ghost ancestors (ancestors with whom, oddly, you share no DNA), and the people outside the Garden of Eden. I was gratified but not surprised when Prof. Swamidass stated that a close reading of the Hebrew suggests that the flood was not worldwide. One of the good things about language is that it is imprecise enough that you can interpret any Biblical passage in any way that is congenial to you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Joshua Swamidass (left) and Nathan Lents describing how attacks by the Discovery Institute pushed them together. This video is a recording of a discussion that took place February 9 and was posted to YouTube, I think, around March 16. I mention it in case anyone else tried to watch the live broadcast; the sound quality of the live broadcast was so poor that I had to bail out. I finally got an opportunity to watch the recording yesterday. On to business: The discussion was not exactly a discussion; it was not exactly about human origins; and “Christian” seems to have been defined more or less to mean “evangelical Christian.” That said, it was an interesting discussion, lasting about an hour and a quarter.

and I spent much of the time since then watching news about
the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the incredible courage
of large numbers of Ukrainians who are resisting it, and the
incredible courage of those Russians who are protesting their
government’s aggression. This post takes a short break from
that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, an article in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; argued, from observations
on the plant &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; that mutation is not
random.  This was the occasion for loud declarations from
creationists and ID advocates that the foundations of the
Modern Synthesis had been undermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04269-6&quot;&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper, which is open access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and here are the responses &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/02/new-study-in-nature-showing-non-random-mutation-spells-trouble-for-neo-darwinism/&quot;&gt;at the Discovery Institute’s site &lt;em&gt;Evolution News and Science Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/are-mutations-really-random/&quot;&gt;commentary from the “peanut gallery”&lt;/a&gt; at Uncommon Descent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and a (short) &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/mutation-bias-reflects-natural-selection-in-arabidopsis-thaliana/14724&quot;&gt;thread at Josh Swamidass’s site Peaceful Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I would like to ask is, whether modern evolutionary theory,
rests on the assumption that mutation is “random”.  And if so,
in what sense does it need to be random for the theory to be
tenable?  I’ll make some suggestions below, but they are 
tentative, and your thoughts are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is there evidence that the mixture of mutations that happen
shifts in response to environmental changes, in such a way that
among those mutations that do occur, a larger fraction of them
are adaptive in those environments?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when one could have mutations that helped the organism
adapt to higher temperatures, do more of those mutations show up?  And when the temperatures are getting colder, do the mutations
that occur become more likely to help adaptation to lower temperatures and less likely to help adaptation to high temperatures?  I
don’t know of any evidence that shifts like this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does modern evolutionary biology have as a fundamental
tenet that mutation rates in all parts of the genome are equal
and that mutations that change bases are equally
likely to result in each of the other three possible bases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, the answer is clearly no, since many models of base
substitutions in neutral mutation have for a long time allowed
for mutation rates to differ in different parts of the genome,
and for the pattern of changes to depart from simple symmetrical
models such as the Jukes-Cantor model.  This includes allowing
models of regional mutation rate variation, such as Hidden
Markov Models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let's discuss ...

Since some of us were concerned about what might lie behind this, I wrote to the Society’s Secretary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mcglothlin.biol.vt.edu/&quot;&gt;Professor Joel McGlothlin&lt;/a&gt;, asking for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our worst fears were confirmed.  We have witnessed an act of preemptive cowardice by the ASN Executive Council, much of value has been lost, and a valuable educational opportunity has been wasted. However, the changes will not take effect until this year’s awards are made.  In the meantime, I would strongly urge all members of the Society who read this, and in particular all awardees, to contact the Society through the Secretary, Professor Joel McGlothlin, at joelmcg@vt.edu, and make their views known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnat.org/awards.html&quot;&gt;awards affected&lt;/a&gt; are the Sewall Wright Award, the E.O. Wilson Naturalist Award, the Jasper Loftus-Hills Young Investigator Award, the Ruth Patrick Student Poster Award, the Julia Platt Postdoc Presentation Award, and the Ed Ricketts Student Presentation Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright&quot;&gt;Sewall Wright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson&quot;&gt;E.O. Wilson&lt;/a&gt; need no introduction from me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnat.org/awards.html#Jasper&quot;&gt;Jasper Loftus-Hills&lt;/a&gt; was an Australian biologist of exceptional promise, killed by a hit and run driver when he was conducting fieldwork, just three years after receiving his PhD. Among numerous other achievements, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Patrick&quot;&gt;Ruth Patrick&lt;/a&gt; established the Department of Limnology at the National Academy of Sciences, and did pioneering work on freshwater biodiversity and how it is impacted by pollution. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Platt&quot;&gt;Julia Platt&lt;/a&gt; was the first to establish the neural crest origin of the cranium, was not able (this was in the 1890s) to obtain a PhD or an academic position in the U.S., went into politics and used her political role to establish one of the earliest marine conservation areas. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Ricketts&quot;&gt;Ed Ricketts&lt;/a&gt; pioneered the study of intertidal ecology, and collaborated with the novelist John Steinbeck.  These are the people whose names the American Society of Naturalists no longer wishes to see prominently attached to their awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Professor Joel McGlothlin, Secretary of ASN, the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who suggested this change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the reasons for the change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did any of the names attached to awards seem to you problematic? If so, which ones, and in what way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long has the change been under consideration?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What debate or discussion took place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What experts were consulted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are no reasons given on the website?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When does the change come into effect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were the membership consulted? Were current holders of the relevant named awards consulted?&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Were Loftus-Hills' family notified in advance of the announcement? If so, when and how?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the Society be giving back the Loftus-Hills' endowment money? If not, how do you justify keeping it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His full reply is given below. Here I summarise the main points of his personal reply in the order given. He starts by saying that the decision should be seen in the context of broader discussion of specific names, such as the decision of the Society for the Study of Evolution to rename the Fisher prize, because of Fisher’s role in eugenics, and of the Society of Systematic Biologists to remove the name of Ernst Mayr from their only named award, because, he says, of “the question of whether having named awards could have the effect of excluding some members.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I had suspected, the motivation behind the changes derived from &lt;a href=&quot;https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/online/the-last-refuge-of-scoundrels/&quot;&gt;recent discoveries&lt;/a&gt; of the close relationship around 1990 between E. O. Wilson and the evolutionary psychologist J. Philippe Rushton.  When it became clear that the Society would have to decide whether or not to rename the E. O. Wilson Award, council members suggested that all awards be renamed (i.e., de-named), on the grounds that doing so “puts the focus on the accomplishments of the awardee rather than on the prestige of the eponymous scientist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since award names are not written into ASN’s constitution, the Council itself decided that this was an appropriate matter for the Council itself to decide, without any kind of systematic survey of the membership.  McGothlin further remarks, “We also knew that it would be able to reach a consensus among Society members.” I am not sure what this means, or how they could have known that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes come into effect this year, but previous recipients of an award will be free to use its old name or the new, as they prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Society is “in the process of corresponding with relevant parties about the name changes where appropriate,” but regarding the Loftus-Hills prize, there has been no attempt to contact the family because they don’t know the address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the individuals whose names are removed from the awards will have remembrances (unspecified) on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many problems here that it is difficult to know where to start.  So I’ll begin with relatively minor matters, and work up towards those that lie at the heart of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loftus-Hills is not a common name, but a quick web search brought up two professionally active people, one in New York and one in Chippenham, both of whom hail, like the commemorated researcher, from Australia.  Perhaps the ANS Council was ashamed to contact them.  It is not clear who the other relevant individuals are with whom ANS is corresponding about the other changes, let alone why they are being approached at this stage, rather than before the key decision was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Council claims consensus, but I suspect that this applies merely to their own echo chamber.  Other members, including honorary life members and previous awardees, did not learn of the matter until the decision was announced on the Society website.  For what it is worth, the one awardee whom I know personally has not written to the council, and is unlikely to do so, but that is out of despair and disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the claim that the removal of names “puts the focus on the accomplishments of the awardee rather than on the prestige of the eponymous scientist,” can anyone take this seriously?  Would it add lustre to the accomplishments of this year’s Nobel Prize winner in physics if instead they were named “Physicist of the Year”?  Perhaps Fields Prize mathematicians would prefer to be known instead as “people who did very good work in mathematics before they turned 40”?  And are we really expected to believe that it would put added focus on the work of holders of named Chairs in universities if those Chairs were made anonymous?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the question of how we should regard E. O. Wilson, the question that clearly lies at the heart of the matter.  Wilson is perhaps best known to the general public for his work on applying evolutionary principles to social organisations, but his other accomplishments ranged from understanding the dynamics of insect societies to the theory of island biogeography. This theory plays a key role in strategies for preserving biodiversity, a lifelong preoccupation. He was a two time Pulitzer Prize winner, an honorary member of 30 different learned societies, and a recipient of the Royal Swedish Academy’s Crafoord Prize, awarded to those who work is comparable in stature to that of Nobel Prize winners, but in areas that the Nobel Prizes do not cover. (There is a Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, but none in biology as such.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem arises, of course, from accusations of racism.  I am not thinking here of ignorant critiques, such as that in the grotesque &lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt; article, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-complicated-legacy-of-e-o-wilson/&quot;&gt;The Complicated Legacy of E. O. Wilson&lt;/a&gt;,” which sees racism in all studies of inheritance and even regards the expression “normal distribution” as showing bias against exceptions (!), but also recently published scholarly work (see, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/online/the-last-refuge-of-scoundrels/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) on the relationship between Wilson and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Philippe_Rushton&quot;&gt;J. Philippe Rushton&lt;/a&gt;. Rushton was no marginal character, but a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/j-philippe-rushton/&quot;&gt;1988 Guggenheim fellow&lt;/a&gt;.  However, he moved over the course of his career from studies of kinship and altruism to generalisations about the degree of parental altruism in different groups to scientifically untenable claims about race as a determinant of intelligence.  Until at least 1990, Wilson strongly supported Rushton’s right to explore racial differences, but here we must be careful to distinguish between Wilson’s words and Rushton’s, and to avoid assigning guilt by association.  I would also like to know much more about how the relationship between the two men developed after 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my own non-expert reading of the story, it does seem that in 1990 Wilson went beyond simply supporting Rushton’s claim to discuss his work on racial differences on its merits, and crossed the line into helping him support unsound racist claims.  However, before proposing any action on the basis of such a conclusion, I would at the least seek the opinions of those who had closely studied the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would then have had the opportunity for an important debate.  There are cases like that of Samuel Colston, a Bristol philanthropist whose money came from the slave trade, whose statue was at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement thrown into Bristol Harbour, and not before time.  There are other cases, such as that of T. H. Huxley, where accusations of racism are not only unhistorical but unjust.  Wilson, it seems, lies somewhere in between.  I would like to learn more about his relationship with Rushton, especially as Rushton moved further from the academically defensible after 1990.  We would then need to weigh this association carefully against Wilson’s magnificent accomplishments, remembering that all of us are flawed and complex human beings, but also that by the time under discussion, racism was already scientifically discredited, and that it remained, and remains, a present evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this happened. No expert opinions were sought.  No new evidence was sought on this fascinating piece of contemporary history.  No E. O. Wilson Award recipients, who might have had a great deal to stay on the matter, were invited to take part in the debate because there was no debate.  Instead, in an unprecedented display of moral cowardice, the Society has made sure that no such debate takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes will not come into effect until this year’s awards are made.  In the meantime, I would once again strongly urge all members of the Society who read this, and in particular all awardees, to contact the Society through Professor McGlothlin at joelmcg@vt.edu .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank numerous colleagues for discussions, including among others Glenn Branch, Joe Felsenstein, and Nick Matzke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the full text of Joel McGlothlin’s reply to my questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for my delayed response. I have tried to answer your questions to the best of my ability. You are welcome to share my answers, but I do ask that you post the text below in its unabridged form if you do so [I would have done this in any case &amp;ndash; P.B.].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your questions about our recent award policy change at ASN. Although I am currently serving as Secretary of ASN and consulted with some of the other Council members when preparing this response, the following represents my own take on the situation and not an official statement from the Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that this change happened as part of a broader discussion across a number of scientific societies. Our sister societies, SSE and SSB, have both either renamed awards or considered it in recent years. In 2020, SSE renamed the Fisher Prize, a change that occurred specifically because of Fisher’s role in the eugenics movement. In 2021, SSB introduced a resolution to remove names from all awards, which functionally would only apply to the Mayr Award, their only named award. This had less to do with Mayr himself than the question of whether having named awards could have the effect of excluding some members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, the recent discussion of named awards in ASN Council became more urgent after the revelations about E. O. Wilson’s correspondence with J. Philippe Rushton. Shortly after the first article about this correspondence was published, we began discussing a potential change to ASN’s E. O. Wilson Naturalist Award. Several members of Council suggested that we should rename all awards, not just the Wilson Award. We met by Zoom and a consensus emerged in the discussion that this would be the right course of action. The reason for the change we gave in our statement reflects the consensus of Council. Simply put, removing names puts the focus on the accomplishments of the awardee rather than on the prestige of the eponymous scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual Council members did speak to various members of the Society, some of whom are currently serving on committees (including award committees), and followed discussion surrounding the potential renaming on social media, but the final decision was made by Council. Award names are not written into ASN’s constitution, so this was a change that could be made by Council as the elected representatives of the membership, and we all agreed that it was appropriate to do so. We also knew that it would be able to reach a consensus among Society members. Indeed, we have received a wide range of feedback about the change, but happily, a majority of this has been positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes are in effect as of this year’s awards, the winners of which have not yet been announced. We will be updating the website soon to reflect the awards’ new names and to include some more information about the change. Previous recipients of the awards are free to use the older name or the current name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently in the process of corresponding with relevant parties about the name changes where appropriate. You asked specifically about the award named for Jasper Loftus-Hills. We have not contacted members of Loftus-Hills’ family because we do not have any information that would allow us to contact them. We would be happy to speak with any family members about the change. ASN established the Jasper J. Loftus-Hills Prize in 1984 in memory of Loftus-Hills, who had died tragically in 1974. To the best of our knowledge, the establishment of the award was not tied to a gift to the Society from the Loftus-Hills family or from another individual. After the first year, the award was changed to the Young Investigators’ Prize and was not renamed for Loftus-Hills until 2011, when the original name was rediscovered by then managing editor Patricia Morse.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;As indicated in our announcement, ASN does not intend to relegate the individuals who previously provided names to our awards—including Loftus-Hills—to the dustbin of history. After Council decides on new names for the awards, the website will be updated to include remembrances of those who previously gave their names to awards. In some cases, we hope to significantly expand what is currently on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Paul Braterman</name></author><summary type="html">On Valentine’s Day of this year, the American Society of Naturalists announced that it was removing individuals’ names from its awards. Since some of us were concerned about what might lie behind this, I wrote to the Society’s Secretary, Professor Joel McGlothlin, asking for clarification. Our worst fears were confirmed. We have witnessed an act of preemptive cowardice by the ASN Executive Council, much of value has been lost, and a valuable educational opportunity has been wasted. However, the changes will not take effect until this year’s awards are made. In the meantime, I would strongly urge all members of the Society who read this, and in particular all awardees, to contact the Society through the Secretary, Professor Joel McGlothlin, at joelmcg@vt.edu, and make their views known. The awards affected are the Sewall Wright Award, the E.O. Wilson Naturalist Award, the Jasper Loftus-Hills Young Investigator Award, the Ruth Patrick Student Poster Award, the Julia Platt Postdoc Presentation Award, and the Ed Ricketts Student Presentation Award. Of these, Sewall Wright and E.O. Wilson need no introduction from me. Jasper Loftus-Hills was an Australian biologist of exceptional promise, killed by a hit and run driver when he was conducting fieldwork, just three years after receiving his PhD. Among numerous other achievements, Ruth Patrick established the Department of Limnology at the National Academy of Sciences, and did pioneering work on freshwater biodiversity and how it is impacted by pollution. Julia Platt was the first to establish the neural crest origin of the cranium, was not able (this was in the 1890s) to obtain a PhD or an academic position in the U.S., went into politics and used her political role to establish one of the earliest marine conservation areas. Ed Ricketts pioneered the study of intertidal ecology, and collaborated with the novelist John Steinbeck. These are the people whose names the American Society of Naturalists no longer wishes to see prominently attached to their awards.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Trialeurodes vaporariorum</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/02/Trialeurodes-vaporariorum.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trialeurodes vaporariorum" /><published>2022-02-28T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-02-28T12:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/02/Trialeurodes-vaporariorum</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/02/Trialeurodes-vaporariorum.html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A geranium plant that I supposedly take care of has a serious infestation with whiteflies. Before dousing the plant with insecticidal soap (a procedure I am supposed to follow every week for a while), I snapped the preceding picture. There is a lot of there there, so I asked Mark Sturtevant exactly what I am looking at. His response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spiky things are a weird part of the life cycle of whiteflies. Although they are in the order Hemiptera, which are 'supposed' to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/incomplete-metamorphosis/&quot;&gt;incomplete metamorphosis&lt;/a&gt; (passing thru nymphal stages before molting into adults), whiteflies are hemipterans that essentially have a larval stage and pupal stage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/complete-metamorphosis/&quot;&gt;holometabolous&lt;/a&gt; insects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see quite a bit going on here in this one picture. I have re-attached your picture with some annotations.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if there are eggs in view. The tiny white specks look more like glandular secretions from the leaf. But there are a few larvae along the top border of the picture, and I have marked some with an L.  You see the pupal stage already (one is marked with a P), but technically these are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/puparium/&quot;&gt;puparia&lt;/a&gt;. When a larva becomes a pupa, the larva usually sheds its cuticle to show the pupa underneath, with its own cuticle. But in whiteflies (and in some other insects like flies and fleas), the larva does not shed its cuticle. Rather, it puffs it out, hardens it, and the pupal stage stays locked inside the larval cuticle. That outer larval shell is called the puparium. Then there are the adults. The large adults are females, and I have marked one with an F. Males are smaller and much more active. Winged males fly and seek out females. I think the one labelled M is a male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the day was warm, and there were lots of males on the window trying to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Dr. Sturtevant about the transparent spheres that clutter the frame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't know what the big spheres are, but it could be like aphids (whiteflies are related to them) which periodically secrete a drop of honeydew. This is excess water from plant sap, and aphids secrete that to concentrate the nutrients. Since whiteflies are always secreting a waxy bloom, a thin wax coating on their honeydew droplets would hold them together. That's a hypothesis, but I don't really know. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Trialeurodes vaporariorum &amp;ndash; greenhouse whiteflies infesting a geranium leaf.

&lt;p&gt;Imperial College has decided not to rename the Huxley Building, in a partial victory for those who oppose “canceling” historical figures who held views that today are properly regarded as racist. Instead, according to an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/234096/imperial-commits-ambitious-understanding-history/&quot;&gt;Imperial commits to ‘ambitious understanding’ of history&lt;/a&gt;, by Deborah Evanson, they will add a second, joint name to the building, in addition to that of Thomas H. Huxley. The second name will be that of “a pathbreaking scientist from a Black, Asian or other minority ethnic background.” The College will also retain a bust of Huxley, but will put Huxley and his accomplishments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;into a fuller context in order to provide everyone with a more complete understanding of Huxley’s complex character and achievements as well as his flaws, including his racially prejudiced writings. Historical context will also be provided for any person whose name is added jointly.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huxley, like most of us, was indeed a complex character. He no doubt thought that white, male Englishmen were generally smarter than everyone else. In that respect he was no different from most white, male Englishmen of his time. Nevertheless, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/12/Matzke-Huxley-comments.html&quot;&gt;an article by Nick Matzke and others&lt;/a&gt; on Panda’s Thumb last December, Huxley devoted himself to educating women and poor people, and actively opposed slavery; he was thus well in advance of many, if not most, of his contemporaries. It is gratifying that Imperial College recognizes this progressive leader and has decided not to dename the Huxley Building because of a flaw that was widely shared in his era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, February 18, I attended (on Zoom) a fascinating seminar given by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/p-kilmartin&quot;&gt;Paul Kilmartin, Professor of Chemistry&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-chemical-sciences.html&quot;&gt;School of Chemical Sciences&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html&quot;&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, here in Aotearoa/New Zealand. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/nmat471&quot;&gt;I work&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-biological-sciences.html&quot;&gt;School of Biological Sciences&lt;/a&gt; at the same institution.) Prof. Kilmartin specialises in wine chemistry, among other things, and in addition to chemistry, has degrees in theology and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kilmartin’s talk was entitled &lt;b&gt;“Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori: A Conversation.”&lt;/b&gt; Kilmartin has given me permission to quote this part of his talk, below, which covers science education material of international interest. I will also include the talk summary. Other parts of Kilmartin’s seminar focused on his own background coming to this issue (Scottish and Māori ancestry, member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/&quot;&gt;Ngāi Tahu&lt;/a&gt;, deep knowledge of Ngāi Tahu history and land claims), and ideas for Auckland’s chemistry program to explore regarding mātauranga Māori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Panda’s Thumb blog has an international readership interested in science and science education, and I have been involved with science education controversies for 20 years (and with PT for 18!). But I’m sure the NZ situation is new to many readers. Therefore, I will give some background/introduction to the controversy around the science curriculum, after the quote from Kilmartin’s talk.  For more (much more) on current science education controversies in New Zealand, please search &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.google.com/search?q=science%2C%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;amp;hl=en-NZ&amp;amp;gl=NZ&amp;amp;ceid=NZ%3Aen&quot;&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=science%20%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/?s=mauri+zealand&amp;amp;orderby=relevance&amp;amp;order=DESC&amp;amp;post_type=post&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; etc. on the various terms mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Please not that all of non-talk material is written by me, and should not necessarily be taken as Kilmartin’s views. And, these are my personal views, not those of current or former employers.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
[Around 27 minutes in, Kilmartin continues...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second Ministry of Education text I would like to comment upon concerns proposals for NCEA science. The courses here involve so-called Big Ideas, and the inclusions of concepts drawn from Mātauranga Māori.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;
These were proposed last year for inclusion in the NCEA curriculum, and have been piloted in some schools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I understand that this year, a further 5 schools will be involved in mini-pilots, with full pilots to take place next year, and full implementation by 2024.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the Big Ideas in the Chemistry area has to do with the properties of matter, as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin1.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what is mauri? Its definition is important for teachers and students alike. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following Glossary is provided, where mauri is defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin2.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[Then follows several minutes of discussion of various definitions and usages of the mauri concept; Kilmartin states that insofar as mauri is used to refer to a concept like individual or ecosystem health, he can work with it.  Kilmartin also discusses Prof. T.K.K.B. Morgan's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mauriometer.com/&quot;&gt;mauri-o-meter&lt;/a&gt;, etc.]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[Resume at about minute 33:00]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But is there more to the concept of mauri than this?  In an earlier publication, within a civil engineers' proceeding, Prof. Morgan provides more background to mauri. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin3.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And there are some new concepts here. Not only do all natural objects possess it, mauri is seen as the binding force between the physical and the spiritual. Indeed, when mauri is impacted and the bond weakened, the physical and the spiritual are separated, leading to death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One question is whether using mauri in the sense of life-supporting capacity implies all of this additional meaning.  If it does, then I would want to ask, Who discovered this binding force between the physical and the spiritual?  And what evidence was involved in its discovery? If this binding force is real, then everyone needs to know about it. It needs to be in the chemistry syllabus of every country, not just in New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So how has this new syllabus been received by teachers? We have one publication on this topic from last year [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.46786/ac21.1591&quot;&gt;Stewart and Tedoldi 2021&lt;/a&gt;], which explains that the inclusion of Māori concepts is an attempt to reflect the principal of equal mana, mana ōrite, for Māori knowledge -- one of the seven principles within the NCEA Change package, announced by the government in May 2019.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin4.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also learn that these proposals have sparked heated discussions, in which NCEA science teachers have referred to Māori knowledge as &quot;myths and legends,&quot; or &quot;’spiritual concepts’ that do not belong in the science curriculum.&quot; Well, good on the teachers for having their say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The authors of this article [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.46786/ac21.1591&quot;&gt;Stewart and Tedoldi 2021&lt;/a&gt;] have other views. The problem with the teachers is seen as a narrow understanding of what is living, as taught under the &quot;MRS GREN&quot; life processes: Movement, Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Reproduction, Excretion, and Nutrition, and I remember teaching MRS GREN in my two years as a secondary school teacher in Christchurch in the early 90s.  Instead this should be expanded to consider a river as living. To support this understanding, teachers are recommended to look to the Gaia concept of the Earth as a living thing. I hadn't heard much about Gaia recently, and it was much more popular in the 80s and 90s, and I might be showing my age here.  I had to look up Wikipedia for some recent information. There is every indication that Gaia has little current following in the scientific community, after some years of more active debate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One final example of mauri is of interest to myself as an electrochemist, given our use of electricity to interface with chemistry.  And this relates to domestic electrical wiring. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worksafe.govt.nz/dmsdocument/1580-new-zealand-electrical-code-of-practice-for-homeowneroccupiers-electrical-wiring-work-in-domestic-installations-nzecp-51-2004&quot;&gt;current New Zealand Electrical Code of Practice&lt;/a&gt;, we are encouraged to think of the Green/Yellow=Earth wire as a Papatuanuku or Earth Mother. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin5.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I must admit, I do have trouble taking this seriously, and I doubt the use of tapu and noa in this matter matches their meaning within Mātauranga Māori.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My own view is that the concept of mauri has no place in the Chemistry curriculum. I would suggest to re-write the Big Idea along these lines:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Conversation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Professor Paul Kilmartin&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The NCEA Education web-site provides the following material for the “Big Idea” named “Properties of matter are determined by attractive forces between particles”, prepared for teaching Chemistry and Biology as a consolidated subject at Curriculum level 6 (NCEA 1):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mauri is present in all matter. All particles have their own mauri and presence as part of a larger whole, for example within a molecule, polymer, salt, or metal. When matter is broken into smaller particles each particle remains as part of the taiao [environment], for example when a substance is burnt or dissolved the particles remain, with their own mauri.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A glossary definition of mauri is also provided:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The vital essence, life force of everything: be it a physical object, living thing or ecosystem. In Chemistry and Biology, mauri refers to the health and life-sustaining capacity of the taiao, on biological, physical, and chemical levels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This presentation will provide a personal perspective on several issues related to Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori. These will include selected points from Ngāi Tahu/family history, through to a critique of recent Ministry of Education publications where Mātauranga Māori concepts are being brought into the School curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The presentation will be organised around the following topics:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moa bones and the Kemp purchase&lt;br /&gt;
Rowallan land blocks&lt;br /&gt;
The Opihi Taniwha&lt;br /&gt;
Ngā Tautake Pūtaiao me ngā Kōrero o Mua&lt;br /&gt;
Chemistry curriculum&lt;br /&gt;
Legitimate voices&lt;br /&gt;
Future opportunities for the School of Chemical Sciences&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A 45 minute presentation will be followed by ample time for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to his chemistry background, Paul has degrees in philosophy and theology, and is a Trustee on two blocks of forested land provided to the family under 1906 SILNA act. His research into family history has been deposited with the Ngāi Tahu whakapapa unit.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;background&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Backgrounder for international readers (by Matzke)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;i&gt;mātauranga Māori&lt;/i&gt; means Māori knowledge.  (It is often just “mātauranga” when the context is obvious; it is often also abbreviated MM.) Often this primarily refers to traditional indigenous knowledge, but it can also include newer knowledge that was developed or incorporated more recently.  Much more detail is available via google, see for example the Māori dictionary and mātauranga Māori and science, from the NZ Science Learning Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hired in NZ in 2018, and I have gradually learned of a widespread movement to promote MM at all levels. For example, it is an aspect of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/agencies-policies-and-budget-initiatives/vision-matauranga-policy/&quot;&gt;Vision Mātauranga&lt;/a&gt;, the governmental strategy for encouraging scientific research that benefits Māori interests. It is promoted in university strategic plans, and in school systems.  All of this is motivated by many honorable values. I cannot list them all, but motivations include everything from (1) making science education and research more interesting and relevant to Māori students, through to (2) encouraging Māori cultural advancement and renewal (much like government promotion of te reo Māori, the Māori language) – especially important to help repair damaged caused by colonisation, through to (3) economic and conservation benefits that could accrue from deploying traditional knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is well and good, and it is hard to see how anyone could reasonably object to these ideas in general. However, specifics and implementation matter a lot, and controversy has recently arisen over a governmental policy to revise the school curriculum with guideline mandating “parity” between “Western science” and mātauranga Māori. In July 2021, seven professors (full or emeritus) from the University of Auckland wrote a letter to a NZ magazine, &lt;i&gt;The Listener&lt;/i&gt;, objecting to this and other Ministry of Education statements. The initial reaction was swift and harshly negative, as some perceived the letter as denigrating mātauranga.  But over time a more normal public discussion ensued in &lt;i&gt;The Listener&lt;/i&gt; and elsewhere (which is ongoing), and now the Vice Chancellor of the University of Auckland, Dawn Freshwater, has stated “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/auckland-plans-dialogue-maori-knowledge-and-science&quot;&gt;Nobody is wrong here&lt;/a&gt;,” and promised to host an academic symposium to thoroughly discuss the various issues raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The symposium was going to be in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/auckland-plans-dialogue-maori-knowledge-and-science&quot;&gt;first quarter of 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but now the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has slipped through quarantine, and NZ is experiencing it’s first huge wave of SARS-CoV-2. I say SARS-CoV-2, because NZ is highly vaccinated and omicron is milder, so hopefully we will avoid most of the actual Covid disease. In any case, the University of Auckland is online-only (mostly) for at least the first half of Semester 1, so I imagine the symposium will likely be delayed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not involved in &lt;i&gt;The Listener&lt;/i&gt; controversy, except to try to defend the principle of academic freedom of everyone involved. To me, the word “parity” could mean a lot of things, NZ generally seems like a place where common sense prevails (rather than everything going to the nuclear option of litigation or political polarisation, as occurs in the USA), and in any case I’m just a recent immigrant, lucky to be here. It seemed to me that the whole debate needed to happen in long-form (rather than letters, petitions, and tweets) where issues can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/448453/let-s-choose-our-words-more-carefully-when-discussing-matauranga-maori-and-science&quot;&gt;discussed thoroughly&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps now this will happen in the VC’s Symposium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there has been a new development. The NZ Ministry of Education’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/&quot;&gt;NCEA (“National Certificate of Educational Achievement”)&lt;/a&gt; released its curricula for a &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;variety of classes at NCEA Level 1&lt;/a&gt; (translation: students approximately age 15-16). NCEA Levels 2 and 3 are essentially university preparatory material, and include high-stakes exams run by NZQA, relevant for credits for University admissions. Level 1 is more basic material, and some students choose to skip Level 1 to go straight to higher levels, but the “NCEA Change Process” will move to Levels 2 and 3 when NCEA Level 1 changes are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NCEA Level 1 includes classes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/chemistry-and-biology?view=learning&quot;&gt;Chemistry and Biology&lt;/a&gt; (CB), general &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/science?view=learning&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; (SC), &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/physics-earth-and-space-science?view=learning&quot;&gt;Physics Earth and Space Science&lt;/a&gt; (PESS), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/mathematics-and-statistics/mathematics-and-statistics?view=learning&quot;&gt;Mathematics and Statistics&lt;/a&gt; (MS). Reviewing the curricula, some of it, including some of the mātauranga Māori content, seems fine, or at least not something to raise a public ruckus about. (E.g., the curriculum is often pretty vague and general, but NZ deliberately decided to not create hyper-detailed curricula like the 1000+ page curricula used in Australia.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some of it is…very surprising. The example that leapt out to me is also the section that Kilmartin critiqued: the chemistry discussion of atoms, molecules, chemical bonds, and conservation of mass/energy/the First Law of Thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some quick translations for the international reader. Please see the NCEA glossary or other online resources for more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ākonga&lt;/b&gt; = students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;taiao&lt;/b&gt; = the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;kaitiakitanga&lt;/b&gt; = guardianship and protection, e.g. of the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;whakapapa&lt;/b&gt; = genealogy framework used to record relationships (genealogical or otherwise), but more generally, it is often used to refer to heritage, inheritance, cultural and familial connections, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;mauri&lt;/b&gt; (quoting from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/chemistry-and-biology?view=subject-glossary&quot;&gt;NCEA Glossary&lt;/a&gt;) = &quot;The vital essence, life force of everything: be it a physical object, living thing or ecosystem. In Chemistry and Biology, mauri refers to the health and life-sustaining capacity of the taiao, on biological, physical, and chemical levels.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NCEA Chemistry and Biology curriculum says (or said as of November 2021, if they change it, which they eventually will have to):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big Idea: Properties of matter are determined by attractive forces between particles&lt;/b&gt;

Mauri is present in all matter. All particles have their own mauri and presence as part of a larger whole, for example within a molecule, polymer, salt, or metal. When matter is broken into smaller particles each particle remains as part of the taiao, for example when a substance is burnt or dissolved the particles remain, with their own mauri. They do not just disappear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is meant by “mauri” here?  We might avoid conflict by imagining that the term is being used here to refer to individual or ecosystem health, as it is some other places in the curriculum. Elsewhere in his talk, Kilmartin notes that concepts of health are something that he can work with as a scientist, and I agree. For example, a toxin might damage an individual organism, chemical pollution might damage an ecosystem, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that interpretation cannot be applied to this Big Idea. For starters, virtually all matter in the Universe has zero to do with health of living things, because it is outside of our solar system. Even if we stretch the health interpretation to some science fiction scenario where humans and other Earth organisms have escaped our solar system, most of the relevance of various “particles” to organismal/ecosystem health is not due just to the particles’ properties; we must also consider their temperature, arrangement, relative amounts, and the needs of the various organisms. Methane in large amounts is toxic to humans, healthy to certain microorganisms, and deadly to all of them on Titan where the temperature is -179.6 degrees Celsius on a hot day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in any event, whatever “life-sustaining” capacity of a particle we might imagine, it decidedly does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; remain upon being burnt. Oxygen (O2) is necessary for human life, but carbon dioxide (CO2), the product of burning carbon-containing compounds like methane in oxygen, is toxic at sufficient levels.  If by “particles”, the NCEA actually meant “atoms”, (a) they should have just said that, and (b) while the “atom” interpretation does refer to something that doesn’t change upon burning, understanding atomic properties is fairly remote from understanding health impacts, which mostly concern how molecules interact with organismal processes, and (c) the term “particles” explicitly refers to “molecule, polymer, salt, or metal” in the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage does not make sense if interpreted as referring to health impacts. What we are left with is the more fundamental definition of mauri, which is closer to its original usage anyway, which is the “vital essence, life force of everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the concept of a life force or vital essence is…vitalism!  And vitalism is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/vitalism&quot;&gt;very old&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6208063/&quot;&gt;very very discredited&lt;/a&gt; idea. Wohler’s 1828 synthesis of urea from inorganic compounds, when it was previously thought to be an organic molecule produced only by life, was later recognized as an early episode in the defeat of vitalism, and is cited in virtually all chemistry textbooks and classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note that, as is always the case when the history of science is explored in depth, the history is more complex than the defeat of vitalism in a single experiment. Vitalism was an amorphous doctrine, not refutable by a single experiment, but it died a gradual death by many cuts, as experiments accumulated that synthesized various organic compounds from inorganic sources. See Ramberg 2000.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern chemistry and biology, especially organic chemistry and biochemistry, essentially arose through the examination and experimental defeat of vitalism, including the defeat of many rear-guard attempts to defend some reduced version of the concept of a life force or life essence – something “extra” beyond material matter and forces which gave living things the breath of life. To have some government bureaucrats try to bring it back into chemistry by administrative declaration is not going to fly.  Seeing vitalism in chemistry standards is as surprising as it would be to see a Geology curriculum endorse Noah’s Flood or the idea that the Earth is 6,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;other_problems&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Other problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems should have been obvious, and they certainly were to the many science teachers who objected. Unfortunately, science teachers’ objections seem to be being hand-waved away by the educational establishment, for example by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.46786/ac21.1591&quot;&gt;Stewart &amp;amp; Tedoldi (2021)&lt;/a&gt;, who seem to be closely involved with the science curricula. They note the strong objections that science teachers voiced to bringing mauri into the Chemistry/Biology curriculum in this way, but they reply by bringing up…Gaia. Even if one ignored Kilmartin’s point, namely that the Gaia Hypothesis is itself controversial, Gaia aims to explain how the Earth is a homeostatic system; it doesn’t solve the problems with trying to bring back vitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are other huge problems with the inclusion of mauri in the discussion of particles, chemical bonds, and conservation of mass.  These include: What will be on the exams? Will one question be a chemical formula, and the next a spiritual concept?  Won’t the inclusion of spiritual concepts in amongst basic chemistry concepts create conflict in the classroom between students (or teachers) with differing spiritual views? Is this even authentic mātauranga, or is it actually something hatched in the bowels of the Ministry of Education in mid-2021 in the service of some goal other than science education? And, especially, how did all of this get pushed through over negative reviews that the Ministry must have gotten from scientists and science teachers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, where is the “e-word”, evolution? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=avoiding+the+e-word%2C+evolution&amp;amp;oq=avoiding+the+e-word%2C+evolution&quot;&gt;Avoiding the e-word in Biology curricula is often a warning sign in itself.&lt;/a&gt; Perhaps the idea is that it can be replaced with the concept of whakapapa, but everything I’ve heard suggests it is wildly oversimplified and basically wrong to equate evolution/phylogeny with whakapapa. But perhaps the Ministry of Education thinks it can just declare they are the same.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a rather profound meta-issue that keeps arising in these discussions, namely, “Who has the authority to speak?”  Professor Kilmartin (in a part of the talk I did not quote) argues strongly that everyone should be allowed to participate in the discussion – scientists, mātauranga Māori experts, and the general public whose children will be educated under these curricula in the schools. I agree, but there is another point worth making. When the subject is a public school curriculum, we should keep in mind the &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; of such curricula: to get everyone on the same page, to supply the basic concepts and definitions and will be taught. If an introductory curriculum requires a complex hermeneutic to correctly interpret it, or if advanced knowledge is required to understand it, then the curriculum is failing at its basic purpose. Being simple and clear, providing a common baseline for everyone, is the &lt;i&gt;whole point&lt;/i&gt; of a curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this post is long enough as it is, so these other questions will have to wait for future posts. I do encourage others concerned about the situation with science standards in New Zealand to get in touch (nickmatzke@gmail.com); the way that problems like this can get solved is by activism.&lt;/p&gt;

Source: UoA webpage. On Friday, February 18, I attended (on Zoom) a fascinating seminar given by Paul Kilmartin, Professor of Chemistry in the School of Chemical Sciences at the University of Auckland, here in Aotearoa/New Zealand. (I work in the School of Biological Sciences at the same institution.) Prof. Kilmartin specialises in wine chemistry, among other things, and in addition to chemistry, has degrees in theology and philosophy. Kilmartin’s talk was entitled “Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori: A Conversation.” Kilmartin has given me permission to quote this part of his talk, below, which covers science education material of international interest. I will also include the talk summary. Other parts of Kilmartin’s seminar focused on his own background coming to this issue (Scottish and Māori ancestry, member of Ngāi Tahu, deep knowledge of Ngāi Tahu history and land claims), and ideas for Auckland’s chemistry program to explore regarding mātauranga Māori. The Panda’s Thumb blog has an international readership interested in science and science education, and I have been involved with science education controversies for 20 years (and with PT for 18!). But I’m sure the NZ situation is new to many readers. Therefore, I will give some background/introduction to the controversy around the science curriculum, after the quote from Kilmartin’s talk. For more (much more) on current science education controversies in New Zealand, please search Google News, Twitter, blogs etc. on the various terms mentioned. (Please not that all of non-talk material is written by me, and should not necessarily be taken as Kilmartin’s views. And, these are my personal views, not those of current or former employers.)
