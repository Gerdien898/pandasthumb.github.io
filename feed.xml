&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chance works in mysterious ways. Shortly after I saw the philosopher Lee McIntyre discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https://centerforinquiry.org/video/how-to-talk-to-a-science-denier/&quot;&gt;How to talk to a science denier&lt;/a&gt; on the Center for Inquiry website, I ran across his splendid little book &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/scientific-attitude&quot;&gt;The Scientific Attitude: Defending Science from Denial, Fraud, and Pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, I snapped it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific attitude is sort of a technical term to McIntyre. He is not interested in demarcating science from non-science, nor in delineating a scientific method; rather, he considers the scientific attitude necessary for science (not that it is limited to scientists). Specifically, McIntyre writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific attitude can be summed up in a commitment to two principles:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(1) We care about empirical evidence. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(2) We are willing to change our theories in light of new evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you think that these principles may be “too vague and unrigorous to be helpful,” McIntyre discusses “what it means &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to care about evidence”: those who do not care about evidence are dogmatic and maintain their beliefs even in defiance of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to Sir Karl Popper. According to the Introduction, it was Popper who made McIntyre decide to become a philosopher of science. I had known of Popper beforehand, but I was somewhat taken by Popper after I read &lt;i&gt;Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge&lt;/i&gt;* around 25 years ago. Popper was mistaken if he thought that scientists actively attempt to disprove their own theories experimentally. More likely, we try to confirm our theories. On the other hand, in the face of an apparent disconfirmation, we are willing to discard our theories or at least revise them. We may develop an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; (auxiliary) hypothesis in order to preserve our theory – but it is not enough to merely state an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis, as many pseudoscientists seem to think; the &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis, needless to say, must itself be disprovable (testable, falsifiable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popper himself notes that some “genuinely testable [falsifiable] theories,” even when found to be false, may be propped up by their “admirers,” who will introduce an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis or otherwise reinterpret their theory in such a way that it cannot be refuted. In other words, judgement is called for, and you have to know when to discard a theory and when to patch it up. If you lack judgement, you lack the scientific attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you decide whether you have the scientific attitude? You do not just cherry-pick facts but rather&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;act in accordance with a well-vetted set of practices that have been sanctioned by the scientific community because they have historically led to well-justified beliefs&lt;/i&gt; [italics in original]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to McIntyre’s prescription, Ptolemaic astronomy (epicycles) was science. Phlogiston theory was science. Alchemy was science. Even though these theories were wrong science, they were science, in part because they were discarded and replaced when they were found to be wrong. Astrology, creationism, flat-earth theory are not science because their “admirers” try to prop them up with unprovable or unfalsifiable rationalizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McIntyre goes on to discuss the case of Ignaz Semmelweis, a physician who in the mid-1800’s employed careful observation and experimentation, and deduced that the cause of childbed fever (puerperal fever) was caused by what we would today call insufficient hygiene. Semmelweis had the scientific attitude, but, alas, no one else did, and Semmelweis died a failure. In his case, the “well-vetted set of practices that have been sanctioned by the scientific community” were unfortunately wrong, and it was decades before they were set right, with who knows how many lost lives. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann, the “codiscoverers” of cold fusion, did not have the scientific attitude, and neither did a lot of other people, but eventually their “discovery” was falsified and laid to rest by those who did. McIntyre cites observations by Popper and Einstein to the effect that a critical attitude needs to precede the concept of falsifiability in the sense that, if you do not have a critical attitude, you will not seek to falsify your own theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not go into detail, but McIntyre mostly rejects the social constructivist model and insists that evidence is required for a paradigm shift. Science, to my mind, ought to have a privileged position when it comes to questions of fact because its “fads” (and it has fads) may be chosen to some extent by preference, but their direction is generally dictated by evidence, not belief or ideology. Thomas Kuhn was correct about paradigm shifts, but paradigms in science are hard to shift and, indeed, shift only when the evidence warrants a shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a philosopher (though a philosopher of science once called me a naïve falsificationist). I will not discuss the portions of the book that worry about demarcation theory, the social sciences, and so on, though I thought that McIntyre might have been just a wee bit supercilious in discussing how many of the social sciences were merely aspiring to be sciences. At least one of his case studies, though, was appalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McIntyre establishes (or perhaps defines) that fraud has to be deliberate: fabrication or falsification of data. Making mistakes, however, is not fraud. McIntyre inveighs against cherry-picking data, searching data for statistical significance, drawing inferences from too small a data set, and so on, though he does not seem to consider those to be fraud. He reminds me of a colleague who once told me, with a grin, that he had to search high and low for an oscilloscope trace that he could call “typical” but which showed all the features he wanted to emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another chapter details incidents of “fraud and other failures.” Many are probably familiar to readers of PT, but McIntyre provides a degree of detail that may not be so familiar. Among the frauds, I am sorry to report, is the “vaccine-autism debacle,” which features Andrew Wakefield, continues to this day, and contributes to the anti-vaccination movement and its attendant outbreaks of disease, again with the penalty of countless lost lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On what McIntyre deems a happier note, the astronomer Andrew Lyne made an error in a publication, explained it to a scientific conference, and received a standing ovation.  That is how science is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the head, “denialists, pseudoscientists, and other charlatans,” we meet those who deny well-established theories and those who insist on failed theories. Depressingly, McIntyre notes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;there has always been a human tendency to believe what we want to believe. Superstition and willful ignorance are not new to the human condition. What is new in recent years is the extent to which people can find a ready supply of &quot;evidence&quot; … on the Internet. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to observe that empirical evidence will not convince people who do not accept empirical evidence. “It is almost as if denialists are making faith-based assertions.” Almost?! He is too kind. Denialists are not skeptics; they are ideologues who refuse to believe conclusions that they do not like but which are based on what everyone else thinks is compelling evidence. Indeed, as he says, the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;denialist pattern [is] to have impossibly high standards of proof for the things that one does not want to believe and extremely low standards of acceptance for the things that fit one's ideology. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, we meet Senator Ted Cruz, who cherry-picks a particularly hot year to “prove” that climate change is a hoax by liberal politicians out for power. It is worth reading McIntyre’s dissection of an NPR interview with Sen. Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will conclude with a warning. McIntyre discusses the case of Harlen Bretz and the origin of the channeled scablands in the state of Washington. Like Alfred Wegener and continental drift or Galileo and heliocentric theory, Bretz accounted for the scablands by postulating a massive flood and providing significant supporting evidence for such a flood; his theory is accepted today. In the early to mid-twentieth century, however, geologists rejected it vigorously, in part because uniformitarianism was “favored by geologists [because] it was seen as a bulwark against the creationists.” That is, geologists were putting ideology ahead of science – what McIntyre calls “an example of how ideology can infect the scientific process, whether we are on the ‘right’ side of it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McIntyre tackles creationism and intelligent-design creationism, which are familiar to readers of PT, and then Robert Jahn’s study of psychokinesis, which I consider flawed science, not pseudoscience. I will not tackle either of those here.  Read the book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/weasel.png&quot; alt=&quot;[Weasel results]&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; Part of a run of a Dawkins's Weasel simulation,
showing it approaching the target phrase &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Eric Holloway has written an article &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindmatters.ai/2022/03/dawkins-dubious-double-weasel-and-the-combinatorial-cataclysm/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; at the Discovery Institute's
 site &lt;em&gt;Mind Matters&lt;/em&gt;, in which he presents a variant on Richard
Dawkins's famous Weasel simulation, one in which there is not
just one target phrase, but two.  You may recall that the
original Weasel program had a target phrase, which was &quot;METHINKS
IT IS LIKE A WEASEL&quot;.  Counting blanks, this is 28 characters
long.  We start with a random string of 28 characters.  Each
generation the single string of 28 characters produces offspring
and they mutate, each character having a chance of changing to one
of the 26 other possibilities (the alphabet is
26 characters plus a blank).  If there are 10 offspring in each
generation, some may match the target phrase in more positions than other do.
In the original Weasel, natural selection occurs by having the
the offspring closest to the target string
replace the previous parent string.
&lt;p&gt;
In Dawkins's original computer simulation, the target phrase was
found in a few hundred to a few thousand steps, depending on the
number of offspring and the mutation rate.  We can compare this
to what would occur without natural selection, by having
a random offspring string replace the parent string. 
In that case, the string just changes at random by mutation, and
one can show that the number of generations that would be needed
to come across the target phrase would be about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;.
That's an awful lot more than a few thousand.
&lt;p&gt;
Holloway's article claims to show that by using not one, but two
target phrases, it can be seen that natural selection is in most
cases ineffective.  A commenter, &quot;Roy&quot;, at Josh Swamidass's
Peaceful Science forum took issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/misunderstanding-weasel-programming/14968&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with Holloway.  Roy's argument
there is fairly convincing, but there is more to be said.
&lt;p&gt;
Let me explain ...

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Weasel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Richard Dawkins introduced his &quot;Weasel&quot; computer simulation
in 1976 in his book *The Blind Watchmaker*.  It was a dramatic
example of how natural selection could achieve a goal far faster
than purely undirected random change.  Many advocates of
creationism are insistent on characterizing natural evolutionary
processes as &quot;random&quot;.  This in hopes of convincing their audience
that evolutionary process are hopelessly bad at achieving
adaptations.  Dawkin's example demonstrates why natural selection
is not making &quot;random&quot; change. The example is an enormously effective
teaching example.
&lt;p&gt;
The result has been that many creationists are obsessed with
showing that Dawkins's argument does not work. By contrast, evolutionary
biologists are only mildly interested, as they have had many
empirical and theoretical examples of natural selection
working to achieve adaptations. Theoretical population genetics
dates back over 120 years, and the mathematics of natural
selection solidified 100 years ago: they have not been
waiting to hear from Richard Dawkins.  For a discussion of
how a Weasel simulation can be made to use the standard
Wright-Fisher model of theoretical population genetics,
see &lt;a href=&quot;http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/wright-fisher-and-the-weasel/&quot;&gt;a post by me at The Skeptical Zone in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.
But that carries us away from the present issues.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous criticisms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some of the most common creationist objections:
&lt;p&gt;
(1) &quot;But unlike evolution, Weasel programs have an explicit
target&quot;.  Yes, Richard Dawkins said so himself at the time.  The
purpose of his simulation was as a teaching example to show
readers how natural selection could be strongly nonrandom.
&lt;p&gt;
(2) &quot;But Dawkins never provided his source code.&quot;  He described
the simulation clearly, and it is very simple.  Many people have
written Weasel programs in various computer languages, and all
have shown results very similar to his.  There is no mystery that
would be solved by inspecting the original code.
&lt;p&gt;
(3) &quot;But the program is intelligently designed!&quot;  So what?  We can
intelligently design computer simulation programs of many natural
phenomena (motion of planets, soil erosion, change of weather,
etc.) and that does not show that those natural phenomena must be
intelligently designed.
&lt;p&gt;
(4) &quot;The Weasel shows 'locking' (or 'a partitioned search'), so that a position does not change
once it matches the target.  That is why it works.&quot;
Consideration of examples published by Dawkins shows that they
do not show &quot;locking&quot;.  But when Weasels have &quot;locking&quot; added, they
 are only slightly better than ones without, and both show adaptation that
is far faster than random wandering.  So this is a minor issue.
&lt;p&gt;
It is rather remarkable how obsessed many creationists are with
the Weasel.  Consider that many of them declare that change within
species is irrelevant to their arguments, because they are only
talking about the origin of major changes of body-plan.  They 
claim to not be making a general argument that natural selection is
ineffective.   Actually, they used to make such arguments, but
they have sworn off doing that.  But the minute someone claims to have an argument that
shows that natural selection is generally ineffective, they &quot;fall off the
wagon&quot; and once again succumb to this obsession.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holloway's criticism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mindmatters.ai/2022/03/dawkins-dubious-double-weasel-and-the-combinatorial-cataclysm/&quot;&gt;Eric Holloway's&lt;/a&gt; 
modified Weasel has two target strings.  In his
trials, the second string was &quot;IT LOOKS LIKE A WEASEL TO ME&quot;.  There
is still one parent string, which starts out being random, and it undergoes
the same mutational process as before.  But this time natural selection
acts by checking each offspring against both targets.  The score
is how many positions match at least one of the targets.  Thus if
a string has 12 positions that match only the first target, another 3
that match only the second target, and one position that matches
both targets, we count 12+3+1 = 16 matches. As before, the offspring
that has the highest score replaces the previous string in each
generation becoming the new parent.. 
&lt;p&gt;
The result is typically a string that matches one target or the other
in every position, but is not identical to either target.  An example
would be &quot;IE LINKS LTKIS  IEA EL EASME&quot;.  How many outcomes have a
score of 28?  There are 26 positions in which there are two possible
matches, and two positions in which there is only one possible match,
positions 7 and 8.  The number of strings achieving a perfect score
is then 2&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 67,108,864.  &lt;em&gt;Oops! Roy has pointed out that I
 made the same mistake that Holloway did, and which Roy corrected.  There are
 three positions that match between the two targets, positions 7, 8, and 9,
 which  means that the number of strings achieving a perfect score is
 2&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 33,554,432.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aha, cries Holloway.  The strings he calls targets are two strings out of this large number,
and we reach all these possible perfect-scoring strings with equal
probability, so the chance that natural selection and mutation succeed in 
finding one of the two target strings in this case is very small.
All he has done, he says, is add
an additional target, but natural selection does not know to go
to one or the other targets, but instead mistakenly &quot;splits the
difference&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is like natural selection is driving the evolution bus down the road and encounters a fork with either a left or right turn. Unable to choose either alternative, natural selection decides to split the difference and plow straight ahead, leaving evolution a smoking wreck.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;Roy&quot; replies to Holloway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At Josh Swamidass's &quot;Peaceful Science&quot; forum, a frequent commenter
whose handle is &quot;Roy&quot; presented a rebuttal of Holloway which started
a discussion thread on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/misunderstanding-weasel-programming/14968&quot;&gt;&quot;Misunderstanding weasel programming&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
Roy demonstrates some misunderstandings on Holloway's part.  His main
criticism is 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... natural selection does not only select one character at a time. It selects the combination of characters in an individual
organism. If a mouse is born with two mutations that give it respectively larger ears and darker eyes, it’s not possible for
natural selection to retain one but not the other - that would require only half the mouse to have a litter of pinkies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What happened is that @EricMH implemented the wrong selection criterion. He’s scoring single characters, when he should actually be
scoring the entire string.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roy is correct, as far as Roy's argument goes.  I want to discuss the matter a little more generally.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holloway and different cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In natural examples, natural selection could work either like Eric's program or like
Roy's program.  These are two legitimate possibilities (and there are others, too).
But what about the target strings?  In natural evolutionary processes there are no
targets.  Different genotypes simply have different fitnesses, and that is the
result of how the genotype affects the phenotype, and how that phenotype
interacts with the environment.   The closest thing to a target is the set
of genotypes of high fitness.
&lt;p&gt;
So if you use Holloway's program, the targets that it is seeking are not the two
sentences.  They are the set of all 2&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; strings that achieve the highest
fitness.   On the other hand if you use Roy's program, the strings that
achieve highest fitness are only the two strings that Holloway describes.
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, there is a behavior of &quot;splitting the difference&quot;, but it is Holloway, not
a simulated evolutionary process, that is doing the splitting.  Holloway is 
running a program that would have 2&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; targets, but declaring that there are
only two target strings.  Holloway would be right about that if he were
running, not his own program, but Roy's.  But he isn't, he's splitting the
difference and instead running his program, which has far more than two
strings of high fitness.
&lt;p&gt;
Both case are possible, but you shouldn't go around arbitrarily declaring
strings as being the targets, when evolution is acting as if there are
far more or far fewer strings of high fitness.  Your argument might be left
&quot;a smoking wreck&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Part of a run of a Dawkins's Weasel simulation, showing it approaching the target phrase Eric Holloway has written an article here at the Discovery Institute's site Mind Matters, in which he presents a variant on Richard Dawkins's famous Weasel simulation, one in which there is not just one target phrase, but two. You may recall that the original Weasel program had a target phrase, which was &quot;METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL&quot;. Counting blanks, this is 28 characters long. We start with a random string of 28 characters. Each generation the single string of 28 characters produces offspring and they mutate, each character having a chance of changing to one of the 26 other possibilities (the alphabet is 26 characters plus a blank). If there are 10 offspring in each generation, some may match the target phrase in more positions than other do. In the original Weasel, natural selection occurs by having the the offspring closest to the target string replace the previous parent string. In Dawkins's original computer simulation, the target phrase was found in a few hundred to a few thousand steps, depending on the number of offspring and the mutation rate. We can compare this to what would occur without natural selection, by having a random offspring string replace the parent string. In that case, the string just changes at random by mutation, and one can show that the number of generations that would be needed to come across the target phrase would be about 1040. That's an awful lot more than a few thousand. Holloway's article claims to show that by using not one, but two target phrases, it can be seen that natural selection is in most cases ineffective. A commenter, &quot;Roy&quot;, at Josh Swamidass's Peaceful Science forum took issue here with Holloway. Roy's argument there is fairly convincing, but there is more to be said.

Mr. Wingfield, the Executive Director of the publication, notes in his article that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;creationism has no support in mainstream science. A 2019 Gallup Poll found that 40% of Americans say they believe in creationism, with the likelihood of holding that belief corresponding heavily toward lower levels of education.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the risk of cherry-picking, he notes further,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Phelps envisioned the museum and life-size ark appealing to home-schooling parents but also wondered if its presence could put a damper on the teaching of accepted science in the region’s schools. He called the teaching of Answers in Genesis “outrageous and remarkable pseudoscience.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a hatchet job, granted, but at least they went after the Ark with a tackhammer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same day, William Trollinger, of the blog Righting America, posted an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rightingamerica.net/ken-ham-and-the-fog-that-enshrouds-ark-encounter/&quot;&gt;Ken Ham and the fog that enshrouds Ark Encounter&lt;/a&gt;, which outlines the financial shenanigans that accompanied the founding of the Ark Park.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rightingamerica.net/ken-ham-and-the-government-subsidy-that-makes-ark-encounter-possible/&quot;&gt;75% of what Ark Encounter would have paid in property taxes instead goes to paying off the bonds that made the Ark possible&lt;/a&gt;. Quite obviously, this is a government subsidy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. Trollinger, the bonds will be fully paid off this month, meaning April. He asks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[D]oes that mean that, after nine years of this very generous local government subsidy, Ark Encounter will finally begin to pay its fair share of property taxes? &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us hope so, but anyone who thinks that the Ark Park has brought prosperity to Williamstown needs to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6316506/&quot;&gt;We believe in dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ken Ham, in his blog, notes on March 26 that there is a labor shortage and proposes &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/ministry-news/issues-facing-ministry/&quot;&gt;building dormitories&lt;/a&gt; for summer students or, indeed, year-round students whose Christian colleges allow them to study remotely.

It is something of a leap to infer causality, but as we shall see in a moment it is a leap made by the authors of the article. (Incidentally, I put “Darwinism” into scare quotes because I do not believe that evolutionary biology is an -ism.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, in brief, Stylianos Syropoulos, a Ph.D. candidate in the War and Peace Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and his colleagues found that in the US and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;across the globe—in 19 Eastern European countries, 25 Muslim countries and in Israel—low belief in evolution was linked to higher biases within a person's group, prejudicial attitudes toward people in different groups and less support for conflict resolution.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The researchers theorized that belief in evolution would tend to increase people's identification with all humanity, due to the common ancestry, and would lead to fewer prejudicial attitudes,&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I think is a more positive phrasing than the title of the article. More specifically,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;People who perceive themselves as more similar to animals are also people who tend to have more pro-social or positive attitudes toward outgroup members or people from stigmatized and marginalized backgrounds,&quot; Syropoulos explains. &quot;In this investigation, we were interested in examining whether belief in evolution would also act in a similar way, because it would reinforce this belief that we are more similar to animals.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the UMass article quotes the technical paper to the effect that “the disbelief in human evolution is the driving factor and most consistent predictor of prejudice in comparison to other relevant constructs.” The actual paper is behind a paywall, so I cannot ascertain how they established causality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors note that others have claimed that the theory of evolution perpetuates racism, prejudice, and homophobia, partly because of the concept of natural selection and the phrase “survival of the fittest.” Senior author Bernhard Leidner, also of the University of Massachusetts, may have gloated a little bit when he said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been theoretical accounts that predict the opposite of what we found, so it was exciting for us to show that this actually is not the case, that the opposite is true and that belief in evolution seems to have pretty positive effects, &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but I think maybe he had a right.&lt;/p&gt;
