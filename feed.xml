  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all too familiar with creationist life science (theory of kinds) and creationist Earth science (Flood geology). As I explain in &lt;a href=&quot;https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2022/10/creationism-in-the-service-of-climate-change-denial.html&quot;&gt;an article at 3 Quarks Daily&lt;/a&gt;, recent decades have seen the emergence of a creationist climate science, which is a direct attack on the “secular” climate science of climate change. Creationist climate science rejects, as it must, the palaeoclimatology that helped establish the existence of positive climate feedbacks, and from this draws the inference that our present concern about human effects on climate is unbiblical, unscientific, and exaggerated. This fits in directly with the agendas of the organisations opposing fossil fuel restraint, and even involves some of the same people. We need to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists cannot avoid accepting a single Ice Age, which they have to regard as more recent than Noah’s Flood. So with great imagination they have devised theories that make the Ice Age an actual consequence of the Flood, and in the process they come to believe that their own theories are biblical. They can then call into play the entire creationist rhetorical apparatus, invoking arguments about biblical versus secular, God’s word versus man’s word, and a conspiracy of secular scientists deliberately hoodwinking the public by ignoring the biblical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is this secular science that lies behind our models of the climatic effects of human activity. In particular, the ability of the Milankovitch cycles to cause such large changes in Ice Age climate shows the existence of positive feedbacks, as further confirmed by detailed ice core studies. The creationists, whom we must not to dismiss as ignorant or ill informed, are well aware of this, and draw the implication that the appeal to positive feedbacks is an artefact of the secularist viewpoint, and should be rejected. They argue from this that current concerns about where the climate is going are misplaced. As I show in my 3QD article, all this is explicitly spelt out in the creationist literature, which links directly to the Cornwall Alliance’s climate change denial literature. This is no accident. The director of the Cornwall Alliance is an active contributor to Answers in Genesis, and the right wing political philosopher Jay W. Richards, who over at the Discovery Institute pours scorn on evolution science and global warming concerns alike, is a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, and a former adviser to Cornwall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, I regard creationist climate science as a much more pressing threat than the usual annoying creationist nonsense. How should we respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young Earth Creationist (YEC) astronomers have declared victory for creationism because of the findings of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our favorite YEC astronomers have finally discussed the JWST at length. On Wednesday, September 14, 2022, on Facebook Dr. Danny Faulkner and Rob Webb of AiG, and Dr. Jason Lisle (formerly of AiG, now at the Biblical Science Institute) discuss the early findings of the JWST for &lt;a href=&quot;https://fb.watch/fymizG2T2H/&quot;&gt;a full excruciating hour&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faulkner and Lisle have PhDs in astronomy. Rob Webb recently was hired by AiG as a preacher/scientist and has experience in aerospace engineering, helping design several different spacecraft (hence his AiG nickname “Rocket Rob”).  Their “discussion” consists mostly of self-congratulation and sundry claims that every new finding supports Young Earth Creationism including having light from galaxies billions of light years away getting to Earth in a mere 6,000 years (a miracle!). Their self congratulations are based on the fact that astronomers are revising their ideas about how quickly galaxies and heavy elements formed in the early universe because of new data from JWST findings. This motley crew seems to be gloating that other astronomers are – gasp! – doing science. Much of the rest of the video is preaching/scripture quoting and, at about 23 minutes in, claiming a nefarious conspiracy of morally questionable “secular astronomers” based on their “worldview.” Most astronomers I know are upright citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 32 minutes in, Drs. Lisle and Faulkner joke about dead Democrats voting in Chicago, and Dr. Lisle claims “dead people vote Left.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dr. Faulkner’s esteemed scientific opinion God created life only on earth, not elsewhere (~36 minutes in). However, he intones, this only includes “physical life like us; I’m not talking about spirit beings like angels and demons, and so forth.” (Is this video from the 13th century?) Then, after a discussion of exoplanets, Dr. Faulkner also tells us that God will destroy stars and galaxies when he creates a “new heavens and a new Earth” (~39 minutes). Golly wow! Thankfully, Dr. Faulkner goes on to rebuff an online questioner who asks about the flat earth, giving Biblical and scientific reasons the ancient Bible-based cosmology is wrong. Dr. Faulkner has even written a thick tome about the subject (for sale at the Creation Museum and Ark Park, as well as online). The three gentlemen then discuss flat earth theory and the psychology of the cultish behavior behind it for a bit. They appear oblivious to the irony, that, in spite of their education, they are promoting a 6,000 year old universe and Earth. When they agreed that it is a “psychological issue,” I stopped the video for a few minutes out of necessity. I couldn’t decide to laugh or cry, so I took a bathroom break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the end (~53 minutes) Dr. Lisle bemoans that mainstream science is ignoring his claim that he predicted the findings of the JWST. He goes on to claim that science itself wouldn’t be possible if the Bible weren’t true. Lisle then posts the inane cartoon in the frontispiece (my screenshot) insulting scientists and intelligent people as well as confusing evolution and cosmology/cosmogony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video ends with mentions of books for sale and touts the Creation Museum planetarium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As a simple example of how natural selection can put functional information
into a population of organisms, I like to point to dandelions growing in
my yard.  They take energy from the sun and grow.  If there are two different
genotypes, one of which processes that solar energy more efficiently, the
frequency of that genotype will increase as it grows more than the other one,
competes better, and produces more seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When we consider a scale of fitness, or a scale of energy-processing efficiency,
this process of natural selection shifts the distribution of genotypes so
that more and more of the dandelions have higher efficiency of energy
processing.  It does not take much calculating to see that the population 
then has increased functional information.  The information does not come mysteriously
from nowhere: energy is flowing from the sun into the plants, and ultimately 
heat is lost to the environment. All of which is a net increase in entropy. 
Evolution is simply slowing down this overall increase, not reversing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This would seem to be an elementary example.  But at the ID-advocacy website
Uncommon Descent, their regular post author Dr. Eric Hedin gets examples like
this wrong.  In a recent post &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/natural-sources-of-information/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natural sources of information?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  he quotes his own book &quot;Canceled Science: What Some Atheists Don't Want You to See&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In systems which are far from thermodynamic equilibrium, differences or gradients in various thermodynamic variables may exist within the system and between the system and the environment. It has sometimes been mistakenly assumed that these gradients could generate the information found in living systems.[i] However, while thermodynamic gradients may produce complexity, they do not generate information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is particularly surprising since Dr. Hedin is trained as an experimental
plasma physicist, actually at my own university.  He obviously got a solid grounding in thermodynamics and information theory.  But somehow he has failed to
apply that correctly to evolving organisms.  Let's look more closely at
his discussion ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the excerpt he quoted, Eric Hedin gives examples of natural processes 
that tend to degrade information.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our sun is a low-entropy source of thermal energy that the Earth receives via electromagnetic radiation. This thermal energy is useful energy in the thermodynamic sense because it can be used to do work. The same is true of energy released by gravitational potential energy being converted into kinetic energy or heat. Waterfalls and solar collectors can produce energy for useful work, but they are sterile with respect to generating information.
In fact, sources of natural energy (sunlight, fire, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.) universally destroy complex specified information, and never create it. What will happen to a painting if left outside in the elements? What happens to a note tossed into a mulch pile? They degrade by the actions of nature, until all traces of information disappear. Or consider an unfortunate opossum killed on a country road. Will its internal, complex biochemistry increase or decrease with time due to the effects of natural forces? We all know the answer. If not eaten by scavengers, it eventually turns to a pile of dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These examples are fine, but they do not consider what happens when there are biological organisms 
present, such as my dandelions.  They can take sunlight, air and water, and make more dandelions,
which would seem to contradict the generalization that Dr. Hedin just made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
He would probably answer that I have skipped over a part of his post where he addressed the 
case where there is a &quot;design template&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Decreasing thermodynamic entropy can only be leveraged into information if a design template and the mechanism to employ it already exist. In this case, the desired information is not being created by the action of the low-entropy energy source; it is merely being transferred from the template to an output product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For an individual clone of dandelions, he would be asserting that when the number of dandelions of 
that genotype increases, that this is no gain of information.  But if the information is &quot;transferred&quot; 
to the offspring, this can happen multiple times, if the parent produces lots of seeds. Which is an 
odd way of bookkeeping the amount of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Things get even worse for his argument when we consider the information that gets put into the genome 
when natural selection favors one genotype over the other.  That is the case I started with.  Choosing 
one genotype out of a mixture, as the predominant genotype on my lawn, is a fundamental operation in 
information theory.  And if that genotype is the better one on a scale of specification or function, 
that is an increase of functional information in the population of genotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Is that information coming from a &quot;template&quot;?  No.  Each genotype might (or might not) be considered
as one of Hedin's templates.  But where is the super-template that says which clone of dandelions will
ultimately predominate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Someone might point to William Dembski and Robert Marks's concept of &quot;active information&quot;, which 
seems to describe information existing in the fitness landscape, the table of fitnesses of all possible 
genotypes.  But that concept, whether sensible or not, is bookkeeping information that is transferred 
by natural processes, such as mutation and natural selection, into the population of genotypes.  It 
therefore already violates Hedin's generalization, so it cannot be used to rescue it.  Hedin's 
sweeping statements are contradicted by the natural processes of reproduction, and the process 
of natural selection which flows from them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Dandelions at Nerstrand Big Woods State Park, Minnesota (c) 2018 Tony Webster, from Wikimedia As a simple example of how natural selection can put functional information into a population of organisms, I like to point to dandelions growing in my yard.

&lt;p&gt;On September 4, Ken Ham blogged on speakers/preachers at his upcoming “&lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2022/09/04/hear-from-stephen-kendrick-tony-perkins-dr.-owen-strachan-and-more/&quot;&gt;Answers for Pastors and Leaders&lt;/a&gt;” event at the Ark. Several are far-right extremists and Christian Nationalists, but one in particular takes the cake: Tony Perkins, the President of Family Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony Perkins merits not only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Perkins_(politician)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; but also an &lt;a href=&quot;http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2012/04/316-tony-perkins.html&quot;&gt;entry in The Encyclopedia of American Loons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ham claims he and his ministry, Answers in Genesis, are against racism, in spite of receiving an &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/dinosaur-fossil.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allosaurus&lt;/i&gt; skeleton valued at $1 million from neo-Confederate and former League of the South Board member Michael Peroutka&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 that is on display at the Creation Museum. Perkins makes Peroutka look moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the usual extreme right-wing policies promoted by Perkins, such as attacks on LGBTQ people and their right to marry, he has some astounding racist ties. According to Wikipedia, he has disquieting associations and also paid Klansman David Duke $82,500 for his mailing list while managing a US Senate campaign. See this part of the Wikipedia page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; On May 17, 2001, Perkins gave a speech to the Louisiana chapter of the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white supremacist group that has described black people as a &quot;retrograde species of humanity&quot;. Perkins said he did not know the group's ideology at the time. In an April 26, 2005, article in The Nation, Max Blumenthal reported that while managing the unsuccessful U. S. Senate campaign of Woody Jenkins in 1996, Perkins &quot;paid former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke $82,500 for his mailing list.&quot; Perkins denied knowing about the purchase. A document authorizing the payment was reported to contain Perkins' signature. The incident resurfaced in the local press in 2002, during Perkins' unsuccessful Senate run. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Kentucky media could be persuaded to cover this, as the Ark receives $1.825 million per year as part of a sales tax rebate incentive from Kentucky Tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reprinted and lightly edited with permission from an e-mail circulated by Mr. Phelps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dan Phelps</name></author><summary type="html">An extreme right-wing racist and Christian Nationalist has been invited to speak at Ken Ham’s Ark in October. On September 4, Ken Ham blogged on speakers/preachers at his upcoming “Answers for Pastors and Leaders” event at the Ark. Several are far-right extremists and Christian Nationalists, but one in particular takes the cake: Tony Perkins, the President of Family Research Council. Tony Perkins merits not only a Wikipedia page but also an entry in The Encyclopedia of American Loons. Ham claims he and his ministry, Answers in Genesis, are against racism, in spite of receiving an Allosaurus skeleton valued at $1 million from neo-Confederate and former League of the South Board member Michael Peroutka in 2013 that is on display at the Creation Museum. Perkins makes Peroutka look moderate. Besides the usual extreme right-wing policies promoted by Perkins, such as attacks on LGBTQ people and their right to marry, he has some astounding racist ties. According to Wikipedia, he has disquieting associations and also paid Klansman David Duke $82,500 for his mailing list while managing a US Senate campaign. See this part of the Wikipedia page: On May 17, 2001, Perkins gave a speech to the Louisiana chapter of the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white supremacist group that has described black people as a &quot;retrograde species of humanity&quot;. Perkins said he did not know the group's ideology at the time. In an April 26, 2005, article in The Nation, Max Blumenthal reported that while managing the unsuccessful U. S. Senate campaign of Woody Jenkins in 1996, Perkins &quot;paid former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke $82,500 for his mailing list.&quot; Perkins denied knowing about the purchase.

&lt;p&gt;Our colleague Daniel Phelps reminds us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Last year, I won the Paleontological Society’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/07/daniel-phelps-paleontological-society-award.html&quot;&gt;Strimple Award&lt;/a&gt; [which recognizes outstanding achievement in paleontology by someone who does not make a living full-time from paleontology]. The Journal of Paleontology just published &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2022.63&quot;&gt;Colin Sumrall’s presentation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2022.64&quot;&gt;my acceptance&lt;/a&gt; as open access papers. Someone let Ken Ham know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we reported the award over a year ago, we decided to post the texts as a separate item.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Our colleague Daniel Phelps reminds us, &quot;Last year, I won the Paleontological Society’s Strimple Award [which recognizes outstanding achievement in paleontology by someone who does not make a living full-time from paleontology].

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that most molecular biologist and genomicists have concluded (erroneously) that the notion of “junk DNA” was a mistake, 
  here comes the Institute for Creation Research to crow about how wrong the scientists were and how the real science shows that humans are descended 
  from Adam and Eve only thousands of years ago.  Above you will find the ICR video (click on the link in the caption, the figure is only 
  a screenshot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardinale, who teaches at Rutgers University, critiques the ICR video in detail in a YouTube video in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/CreationMyths&quot;&gt;“Creation Myths” YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.  (Take a look at the other videos, there is a lot of good stuff there).&lt;/p&gt;
