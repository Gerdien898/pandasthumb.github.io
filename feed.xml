&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of geologists from West Virginia University has discovered what are apparently living cells in halite (rock salt) estimated to be 830 Ma old and more than 1.5 km below the surface. You may read a summary by Michelle Starr in &lt;i&gt;Science Alert&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/830-million-year-old-microorganisms-found-trapped-in-australian-rock&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or you may find the full article in &lt;i&gt;Geology&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1130/G49957.1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geologists used optical and ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy and found what they think are algal and prokaryotic cells trapped inside liquid inclusions in the halite. It is at least possible that the cells are alive, judging by the fluorescence spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked with a biologist, who confirmed my intuition that a seed or a spore, in order to remain alive, must display at least minimal metabolism. It is therefore hard to imagine a spore lasting for so many years, and indeed the &lt;i&gt;Geology&lt;/i&gt; paper notes that the “microorganisms may survive in fluid inclusions by metabolic changes, including starvation survival and cyst stages, and coexistence with organic compounds or dead cells that could serve as nutrient sources,” that is, that they may have been active sometimes and dormant at other times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, we used some green branches as tomato stakes. At the end of the season, we noticed some green leaves at the top end of one or more of the stakes. “How stubborn life is!” my mother exclaimed. She did not know the half of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me thank Joe Felsenstein for &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/05/rosenhouse-on-mathematical-anti-evolutionism.html&quot;&gt;mentioning my new book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism&lt;/i&gt;, which is now available from Cambridge University Press.  The original intention was for a book discussing mathematics and evolution more generally, with just one section devoted to anti-evolutionary nonsense.  But when that section ran into the hundreds of pages with no end in sight, we decided just to make the whole book a response to the nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematics has considerable propaganda value for anti-evolutionists since it can be used to confuse a lay audience into thinking that something profound has been said.  It also offers the possibility of an in-principle argument.  If the numbers say evolution is impossible then that is the end of the story, regardless of any circumstantial evidence drawn from paleontology, genetics, anatomy, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, I analyze all of the main threads of mathematical anti-evolutionism and explain why none of them work at all.  Along the way I explain how to think clearly about probability, information, combinatorial search, and thermodynamics.  However, it is worth noting that even without wading into the technical details, we have a right to be deeply skeptical of the whole project.  After all, the ingredients of the evolutionary process are all just empirical facts.  Genes really do mutate, sometimes leading to new functionalities, and natural selection really can string together these novelties into directional evolutionary change.  If evolution can account for small changes over human timescales, it’s hard to believe that an abstract mathematical argument will fundamentally rule out larger changes over longer time scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as soon as you look into the details of their arguments you realize that the mathematics invariably plays only a ceremonial role in their discourse.  The equations and theorems never really contribute anything; it’s always something else that does the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider Dembski’s notion of complex, specified information.  Recall that in this context, “complex” means low probability, while “specified” means that there is a recognizable pattern.  In his book &lt;i&gt;No Free Lunch&lt;/i&gt;, Dembski attempted to apply this notion to the bacterial flagellum.  He based his probability calculation on the assumption that an “irreducibly complex” system (meaning, roughly, that the system requires all of its parts to function) cannot evolve gradually.  Interestingly, Michael Behe devoted a whole book to defending this assumption, and he certainly didn’t seem to think that an additional probability calculation was needed to strengthen his argument.  If the assumption is correct, then it’s all by itself a strong argument against evolution, and the probability calculation is irrelevant.  Since the assumption is patently false, any calculation based on its truth is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behe himself presented some probability calculations in his book &lt;i&gt;The Edge of Evolution&lt;/i&gt;.  This time his argument was that certain evolutionary novelties, such as choloroquine resistance in the malaria parasite, require multiple simultaneous mutations because there is no selectable function until all the mutations are in place.  To bolster this argument, he presented some highly dubious calculations meant to show the probability of such mutational sequences was extremely low.  But here again the calculation was irrelevant.  It was the assumption that whole mutational sequences were required all at once that was doing all the work.  Once again, if that assumption is correct then no probability calculation is needed, but since it is not the calculations were irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the anti-evolutionists invoke a mathematical principle rather than carry out a calculation.  They go on at length about the “No Free Lunch” (NFL) theorems, for example.  These are legitimate mathematical results that establish the non-existence of a universally successful search algorithm.  Dembski, sometimes with various coauthors, has argued that since evolution is in some way analogous to a combinatorial search, these theorems imply that any success that it has can only result from intelligent tailoring of nature’s fitness landscapes to the “algorithm” of natural selection. But once again the theorem plays only a rhetorical role in the argument.  Since nature’s fitness landscapes arise ultimately from the laws of physics, Dembski and his collaborators are really just asking why the universe has just the properties it does.  It’s a reasonable question, but it’s not one biologists need to worry about, and it’s not one to which the NFL theorems make any contribution toward answering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pattern occurs again in their invocations of the second law of thermodynamics.  The second law—the real thing as opposed to the asinine caricatures about randomness and disorder—is a mathematical inequality that precisely quantifies the permissible amount of entropy change that can result from a thermodynamic process.  If you are not using any of the mathematical machinery of thermodynamics, if instead you are just making vague statements to the effect that the second law rules out the possibility of organisms growing more complex over time, then there is no reason to bring up thermodynamics at all.  Everyone agrees that the growth in complexity over time requires a special sort of explanation.  Scientists believe they have such an explanation while the anti-evolutionists demur, but the important point is that the resulting argument has nothing to do with thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It requires writing at book length to discuss the myriad conceptual and scientific errors of mathematical anti-evolutionism, and if you are interested in exploring that topic, then I know a good book you can read.  But even without all that effort you can be certain that their arguments amount to nothing.  If someone claims he can refute evolution with a back-of-the-envelope probability calculation or by invoking some abstract principle or theorem, then you can, with total confidence, dismiss the claim out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Jason Rosenhouse, &lt;em&gt;The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism&lt;/em&gt;.  Cambridge
University Press, 2022.
&lt;p&gt;

Written by a mathematician who has paid close attention to mathematical arguments
against evolution, this is a beautifully written and careful refutation of
those arguments.  Actually, that sentence I plagiarized from the back cover
of this book.  But I don't have to worry about having done that, since it
comes from a blurb written by me.  I also gave Jason Rosenhouse comments on the
manuscript.
&lt;p&gt;
Jason Rosenhouse is a professor of mathematics at James Madison University
who also writes popularizations of his field, including a book on the
mathematics of Sudoku and one on the Monty Hall Problem (you know:
the one with the doors and the goats).  Is he overreaching by taking on
creationist and ID arguments?  Hardly: he has written extensively
on this, including many posts here in PT starting in its first year. For a while had his own
blog called EvolutionBlog.  He attended creationist and ID conferences
and wrote about that experience in his 2012 book, &lt;em&gt;Among the Creationists. Dispatches from the Anti-Evolutionist Front Line&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
This is a lovely and fascinating book which covers the most
widely-cited mathematical arguments against evolution, explaining them and
their weaknesses lucidly for a general audience.  If you are not
writing a review for one of the Discovery Institute sites, you
will be impressed.
&lt;p&gt;
Let me outline the chapters, to give you a general picture of what
is covered ...
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are the chapters and some indication of their contents:
&lt;p&gt;
1. Scientists and Their Hecklers.  Outlines the types of
critics and the way they operate, and explains why
mathematics gets involved.
&lt;p&gt;
2. Evolution Basics.  Outlines evolutionary theory, and
introduces the arguments from complex structures,
unbridgeable gaps, and irreducible complexity.  Plus
a section on &quot;Paying A Price for Being Wrong&quot;.
&lt;p&gt;
3. The Parallel Tracks of Mathematical Reasoning. Explains
how mathematical modeling and logical proof interact
in explaining natural phenomena, and why arguments such
as the rareness of well-adapted organisms in a genotype
space don't work.
&lt;p&gt;
4. The Legacy of the Wistar Conference.  Using the
1966 conference called by some mathematical critics
of evolutionary biology, explains why their critiques
were refuted, and how present-day creationists
misrepresent what was said at that conference.
&lt;p&gt;
5. Probability Theory.  Examples from cards and from
the Hardy-Weinberg calculation in population genetics
lead to a consideration of the argument from
improbability, and its use in William Dembski's
argument from Complex Specified Information and
Michael Behe's argument about the Edge of Evolution.
&lt;p&gt;
6. Information and Combinatorial Search.  Information
theory, claims that random mutations always decrease
the information content of biological systems.
Protein space.  Dawkins' Weasel. The No Free Lunch Theorem.
Artifical life. Dembski and Marks's Conservation
of Information, and fine tuning of the universe.
&lt;p&gt;
7. Thermodynamics. Entropy, thermodynamic laws, and
statistical mechanics. Arguments from entropy and
statistical mechanics.  Henry Morris's Second Law
argument. Granville Sewell's revived Second Law
argument.
&lt;p&gt;
8. Epilogue.  Bad math can be rhetorically
effective.  Can human intelligence build
complex adaptations?
&lt;p&gt;
In addition, each chapter ends with Notes
and Further Reading, typically 2-3 pages
of notes, each with a one or more references
for further reading.
&lt;p&gt;
In short, this is a treasure.  Is it perfect?
Of course not.  As someone who, like most of
us, thinks visually, I would have liked to see
more figures.  The argument fom fine-tuning
is hammered into the ground at a bit more
length than necessary.  The cover design is
lovely, but I don't know what it symbolizes.
And computers have not &quot;been used to
simulate evolution since the late 1960s&quot;, but
actually since the mid-1950s.
&lt;p&gt;
Jason Rosenhouse's book will be cited frequently
in future arguments about mathematical
dismissals of evolution.  And should be.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Jason Rosenhouse, The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism.

According to Jerry Coyne, Eric Hedin beefs about being “canceled” at Ball State by the FFRF and me, but forgives me, showing a cat leading me to Jesus!. I incline to agree with Prof. Coyne: Prof. Hedin was by no means canceled; he was promoted for Chrissake! At any rate, Prof. Hedin has now written a book published by the Discovery Institute, presumably because no real publisher would touch it. His video, Canceled Science, may be found here. I have not watched it yet, but I promise to do so when I return home and comment if I think it is appropriate. Meanwhile, I suggest that you enjoy Prof. Coyne’s article.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Scientific Attitude: book review</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/04/scientific-attitude.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Scientific Attitude: book review" /><published>2022-04-29T11:10:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-04-29T11:10:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/04/scientific-attitude</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/04/scientific-attitude.html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chance works in mysterious ways. Shortly after I saw the philosopher Lee McIntyre discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https://centerforinquiry.org/video/how-to-talk-to-a-science-denier/&quot;&gt;How to talk to a science denier&lt;/a&gt; on the Center for Inquiry website, I ran across his splendid little book &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/scientific-attitude&quot;&gt;The Scientific Attitude: Defending Science from Denial, Fraud, and Pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, I snapped it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific attitude is sort of a technical term to McIntyre. He is not interested in demarcating science from non-science, nor in delineating a scientific method; rather, he considers the scientific attitude necessary for science (not that it is limited to scientists). Specifically, McIntyre writes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific attitude can be summed up in a commitment to two principles:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(1) We care about empirical evidence. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(2) We are willing to change our theories in light of new evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you think that these principles may be “too vague and unrigorous to be helpful,” McIntyre discusses “what it means &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to care about evidence”: those who do not care about evidence are dogmatic and maintain their beliefs even in defiance of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to Sir Karl Popper. According to the Introduction, it was Popper who made McIntyre decide to become a philosopher of science. I had known of Popper beforehand, but I was somewhat taken by Popper after I read &lt;i&gt;Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge&lt;/i&gt;* around 25 years ago. Popper was mistaken if he thought that scientists actively attempt to disprove their own theories experimentally. More likely, we try to confirm our theories. On the other hand, in the face of an apparent disconfirmation, we are willing to discard our theories or at least revise them. We may develop an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; (auxiliary) hypothesis in order to preserve our theory – but it is not enough to merely state an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis, as many pseudoscientists seem to think; the &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis, needless to say, must itself be disprovable (testable, falsifiable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popper himself notes that some “genuinely testable [falsifiable] theories,” even when found to be false, may be propped up by their “admirers,” who will introduce an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis or otherwise reinterpret their theory in such a way that it cannot be refuted. In other words, judgement is called for, and you have to know when to discard a theory and when to patch it up. If you lack judgement, you lack the scientific attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you decide whether you have the scientific attitude? You do not just cherry-pick facts but rather&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;act in accordance with a well-vetted set of practices that have been sanctioned by the scientific community because they have historically led to well-justified beliefs&lt;/i&gt; [italics in original]. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to McIntyre’s prescription, Ptolemaic astronomy (epicycles) was science. Phlogiston theory was science. Alchemy was science. Even though these theories were wrong science, they were science, in part because they were discarded and replaced when they were found to be wrong. Astrology, creationism, flat-earth theory are not science because their “admirers” try to prop them up with unprovable or unfalsifiable rationalizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McIntyre goes on to discuss the case of Ignaz Semmelweis, a physician who in the mid-1800’s employed careful observation and experimentation, and deduced that the cause of childbed fever (puerperal fever) was caused by what we would today call insufficient hygiene. Semmelweis had the scientific attitude, but, alas, no one else did, and Semmelweis died a failure. In his case, the “well-vetted set of practices that have been sanctioned by the scientific community” were unfortunately wrong, and it was decades before they were set right, with who knows how many lost lives. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann, the “codiscoverers” of cold fusion, did not have the scientific attitude, and neither did a lot of other people, but eventually their “discovery” was falsified and laid to rest by those who did. McIntyre cites observations by Popper and Einstein to the effect that a critical attitude needs to precede the concept of falsifiability in the sense that, if you do not have a critical attitude, you will not seek to falsify your own theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not go into detail, but McIntyre mostly rejects the social constructivist model and insists that evidence is required for a paradigm shift. Science, to my mind, ought to have a privileged position when it comes to questions of fact because its “fads” (and it has fads) may be chosen to some extent by preference, but their direction is generally dictated by evidence, not belief or ideology. Thomas Kuhn was correct about paradigm shifts, but paradigms in science are hard to shift and, indeed, shift only when the evidence warrants a shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a philosopher (though a philosopher of science once called me a naïve falsificationist). I will not discuss the portions of the book that worry about demarcation theory, the social sciences, and so on, though I thought that McIntyre might have been just a wee bit supercilious in discussing how many of the social sciences were merely aspiring to be sciences. At least one of his case studies, though, was appalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McIntyre establishes (or perhaps defines) that fraud has to be deliberate: fabrication or falsification of data. Making mistakes, however, is not fraud. McIntyre inveighs against cherry-picking data, searching data for statistical significance, drawing inferences from too small a data set, and so on, though he does not seem to consider those to be fraud. He reminds me of a colleague who once told me, with a grin, that he had to search high and low for an oscilloscope trace that he could call “typical” but which showed all the features he wanted to emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another chapter details incidents of “fraud and other failures.” Many are probably familiar to readers of PT, but McIntyre provides a degree of detail that may not be so familiar. Among the frauds, I am sorry to report, is the “vaccine-autism debacle,” which features Andrew Wakefield, continues to this day, and contributes to the anti-vaccination movement and its attendant outbreaks of disease, again with the penalty of countless lost lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On what McIntyre deems a happier note, the astronomer Andrew Lyne made an error in a publication, explained it to a scientific conference, and received a standing ovation.  That is how science is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the head, “denialists, pseudoscientists, and other charlatans,” we meet those who deny well-established theories and those who insist on failed theories. Depressingly, McIntyre notes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;there has always been a human tendency to believe what we want to believe. Superstition and willful ignorance are not new to the human condition. What is new in recent years is the extent to which people can find a ready supply of &quot;evidence&quot; … on the Internet. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to observe that empirical evidence will not convince people who do not accept empirical evidence. “It is almost as if denialists are making faith-based assertions.” Almost?! He is too kind. Denialists are not skeptics; they are ideologues who refuse to believe conclusions that they do not like but which are based on what everyone else thinks is compelling evidence. Indeed, as he says, the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;denialist pattern [is] to have impossibly high standards of proof for the things that one does not want to believe and extremely low standards of acceptance for the things that fit one's ideology. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, we meet Senator Ted Cruz, who cherry-picks a particularly hot year to “prove” that climate change is a hoax by liberal politicians out for power. It is worth reading McIntyre’s dissection of an NPR interview with Sen. Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will conclude with a warning. McIntyre discusses the case of Harlen Bretz and the origin of the channeled scablands in the state of Washington. Like Alfred Wegener and continental drift or Galileo and heliocentric theory, Bretz accounted for the scablands by postulating a massive flood and providing significant supporting evidence for such a flood; his theory is accepted today. In the early to mid-twentieth century, however, geologists rejected it vigorously, in part because uniformitarianism was “favored by geologists [because] it was seen as a bulwark against the creationists.” That is, geologists were putting ideology ahead of science – what McIntyre calls “an example of how ideology can infect the scientific process, whether we are on the ‘right’ side of it or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McIntyre tackles creationism and intelligent-design creationism, which are familiar to readers of PT, and then Robert Jahn’s study of psychokinesis, which I consider flawed science, not pseudoscience. I will not tackle either of those here.  Read the book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/weasel.png&quot; alt=&quot;[Weasel results]&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; Part of a run of a Dawkins's Weasel simulation,
showing it approaching the target phrase &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Eric Holloway has written an article &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindmatters.ai/2022/03/dawkins-dubious-double-weasel-and-the-combinatorial-cataclysm/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; at the Discovery Institute's
 site &lt;em&gt;Mind Matters&lt;/em&gt;, in which he presents a variant on Richard
Dawkins's famous Weasel simulation, one in which there is not
just one target phrase, but two.  You may recall that the
original Weasel program had a target phrase, which was &quot;METHINKS
IT IS LIKE A WEASEL&quot;.  Counting blanks, this is 28 characters
long.  We start with a random string of 28 characters.  Each
generation the single string of 28 characters produces offspring
and they mutate, each character having a chance of changing to one
of the 26 other possibilities (the alphabet is
26 characters plus a blank).  If there are 10 offspring in each
generation, some may match the target phrase in more positions than other do.
In the original Weasel, natural selection occurs by having the
the offspring closest to the target string
replace the previous parent string.
&lt;p&gt;
In Dawkins's original computer simulation, the target phrase was
found in a few hundred to a few thousand steps, depending on the
number of offspring and the mutation rate.  We can compare this
to what would occur without natural selection, by having
a random offspring string replace the parent string. 
In that case, the string just changes at random by mutation, and
one can show that the number of generations that would be needed
to come across the target phrase would be about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;.
That's an awful lot more than a few thousand.
&lt;p&gt;
Holloway's article claims to show that by using not one, but two
target phrases, it can be seen that natural selection is in most
cases ineffective.  A commenter, &quot;Roy&quot;, at Josh Swamidass's
Peaceful Science forum took issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/misunderstanding-weasel-programming/14968&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; with Holloway.  Roy's argument
there is fairly convincing, but there is more to be said.
&lt;p&gt;
Let me explain ...

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Weasel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Richard Dawkins introduced his &quot;Weasel&quot; computer simulation
in 1976 in his book *The Blind Watchmaker*.  It was a dramatic
example of how natural selection could achieve a goal far faster
than purely undirected random change.  Many advocates of
creationism are insistent on characterizing natural evolutionary
processes as &quot;random&quot;.  This in hopes of convincing their audience
that evolutionary process are hopelessly bad at achieving
adaptations.  Dawkin's example demonstrates why natural selection
is not making &quot;random&quot; change. The example is an enormously effective
teaching example.
&lt;p&gt;
The result has been that many creationists are obsessed with
showing that Dawkins's argument does not work. By contrast, evolutionary
biologists are only mildly interested, as they have had many
empirical and theoretical examples of natural selection
working to achieve adaptations. Theoretical population genetics
dates back over 120 years, and the mathematics of natural
selection solidified 100 years ago: they have not been
waiting to hear from Richard Dawkins.  For a discussion of
how a Weasel simulation can be made to use the standard
Wright-Fisher model of theoretical population genetics,
see &lt;a href=&quot;http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/wright-fisher-and-the-weasel/&quot;&gt;a post by me at The Skeptical Zone in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.
But that carries us away from the present issues.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Previous criticisms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here are some of the most common creationist objections:
&lt;p&gt;
(1) &quot;But unlike evolution, Weasel programs have an explicit
target&quot;.  Yes, Richard Dawkins said so himself at the time.  The
purpose of his simulation was as a teaching example to show
readers how natural selection could be strongly nonrandom.
&lt;p&gt;
(2) &quot;But Dawkins never provided his source code.&quot;  He described
the simulation clearly, and it is very simple.  Many people have
written Weasel programs in various computer languages, and all
have shown results very similar to his.  There is no mystery that
would be solved by inspecting the original code.
&lt;p&gt;
(3) &quot;But the program is intelligently designed!&quot;  So what?  We can
intelligently design computer simulation programs of many natural
phenomena (motion of planets, soil erosion, change of weather,
etc.) and that does not show that those natural phenomena must be
intelligently designed.
&lt;p&gt;
(4) &quot;The Weasel shows 'locking' (or 'a partitioned search'), so that a position does not change
once it matches the target.  That is why it works.&quot;
Consideration of examples published by Dawkins shows that they
do not show &quot;locking&quot;.  But when Weasels have &quot;locking&quot; added, they
 are only slightly better than ones without, and both show adaptation that
is far faster than random wandering.  So this is a minor issue.
&lt;p&gt;
It is rather remarkable how obsessed many creationists are with
the Weasel.  Consider that many of them declare that change within
species is irrelevant to their arguments, because they are only
talking about the origin of major changes of body-plan.  They 
claim to not be making a general argument that natural selection is
ineffective.   Actually, they used to make such arguments, but
they have sworn off doing that.  But the minute someone claims to have an argument that
shows that natural selection is generally ineffective, they &quot;fall off the
wagon&quot; and once again succumb to this obsession.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holloway's criticism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mindmatters.ai/2022/03/dawkins-dubious-double-weasel-and-the-combinatorial-cataclysm/&quot;&gt;Eric Holloway's&lt;/a&gt; 
modified Weasel has two target strings.  In his
trials, the second string was &quot;IT LOOKS LIKE A WEASEL TO ME&quot;.  There
is still one parent string, which starts out being random, and it undergoes
the same mutational process as before.  But this time natural selection
acts by checking each offspring against both targets.  The score
is how many positions match at least one of the targets.  Thus if
a string has 12 positions that match only the first target, another 3
that match only the second target, and one position that matches
both targets, we count 12+3+1 = 16 matches. As before, the offspring
that has the highest score replaces the previous string in each
generation becoming the new parent.. 
&lt;p&gt;
The result is typically a string that matches one target or the other
in every position, but is not identical to either target.  An example
would be &quot;IE LINKS LTKIS  IEA EL EASME&quot;.  How many outcomes have a
score of 28?  There are 26 positions in which there are two possible
matches, and two positions in which there is only one possible match,
positions 7 and 8.  The number of strings achieving a perfect score
is then 2&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 67,108,864.  &lt;em&gt;Oops! Roy has pointed out that I
 made the same mistake that Holloway did, and which Roy corrected.  There are
 three positions that match between the two targets, positions 7, 8, and 9,
 which  means that the number of strings achieving a perfect score is
 2&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 33,554,432.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aha, cries Holloway.  The strings he calls targets are two strings out of this large number,
and we reach all these possible perfect-scoring strings with equal
probability, so the chance that natural selection and mutation succeed in 
finding one of the two target strings in this case is very small.
All he has done, he says, is add
an additional target, but natural selection does not know to go
to one or the other targets, but instead mistakenly &quot;splits the
difference&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is like natural selection is driving the evolution bus down the road and encounters a fork with either a left or right turn. Unable to choose either alternative, natural selection decides to split the difference and plow straight ahead, leaving evolution a smoking wreck.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&quot;Roy&quot; replies to Holloway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At Josh Swamidass's &quot;Peaceful Science&quot; forum, a frequent commenter
whose handle is &quot;Roy&quot; presented a rebuttal of Holloway which started
a discussion thread on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/misunderstanding-weasel-programming/14968&quot;&gt;&quot;Misunderstanding weasel programming&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
Roy demonstrates some misunderstandings on Holloway's part.  His main
criticism is 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... natural selection does not only select one character at a time. It selects the combination of characters in an individual
organism. If a mouse is born with two mutations that give it respectively larger ears and darker eyes, it’s not possible for
natural selection to retain one but not the other - that would require only half the mouse to have a litter of pinkies.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
...
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What happened is that @EricMH implemented the wrong selection criterion. He’s scoring single characters, when he should actually be
scoring the entire string.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Roy is correct, as far as Roy's argument goes.  I want to discuss the matter a little more generally.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holloway and different cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In natural examples, natural selection could work either like Eric's program or like
Roy's program.  These are two legitimate possibilities (and there are others, too).
But what about the target strings?  In natural evolutionary processes there are no
targets.  Different genotypes simply have different fitnesses, and that is the
result of how the genotype affects the phenotype, and how that phenotype
interacts with the environment.   The closest thing to a target is the set
of genotypes of high fitness.
&lt;p&gt;
So if you use Holloway's program, the targets that it is seeking are not the two
sentences.  They are the set of all 2&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; strings that achieve the highest
fitness.   On the other hand if you use Roy's program, the strings that
achieve highest fitness are only the two strings that Holloway describes.
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, there is a behavior of &quot;splitting the difference&quot;, but it is Holloway, not
a simulated evolutionary process, that is doing the splitting.  Holloway is 
running a program that would have 2&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; targets, but declaring that there are
only two target strings.  Holloway would be right about that if he were
running, not his own program, but Roy's.  But he isn't, he's splitting the
difference and instead running his program, which has far more than two
strings of high fitness.
&lt;p&gt;
Both case are possible, but you shouldn't go around arbitrarily declaring
strings as being the targets, when evolution is acting as if there are
far more or far fewer strings of high fitness.  Your argument might be left
&quot;a smoking wreck&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Part of a run of a Dawkins's Weasel simulation, showing it approaching the target phrase Eric Holloway has written an article here at the Discovery Institute's site Mind Matters, in which he presents a variant on Richard Dawkins's famous Weasel simulation, one in which there is not just one target phrase, but two.

In the original Weasel, natural selection occurs by having the the offspring closest to the target string replace the previous parent string. In Dawkins's original computer simulation, the target phrase was found in a few hundred to a few thousand steps, depending on the number of offspring and the mutation rate. We can compare this to what would occur without natural selection, by having a random offspring string replace the parent string. In that case, the string just changes at random by mutation, and one can show that the number of generations that would be needed to come across the target phrase would be about 1040. That's an awful lot more than a few thousand. Holloway's article claims to show that by using not one, but two target phrases, it can be seen that natural selection is in most cases ineffective. A commenter, &quot;Roy&quot;, at Josh Swamidass's Peaceful Science forum took issue here with Holloway. Roy's argument there is fairly convincing, but there is more to be said.
