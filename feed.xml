&lt;p&gt;I try to keep up with the Discovery Institute’s site Evolution News and Science Today’.  It used to
be called ‘Evolution News and Views’ but they presumably wanted to emphasize that all that was
published there is hard factual information, so they changed the name.  I am getting a bit
behind: on the 24th of September there was a remarkable article written by Brian Miller, the Research Coordinator
of the DI’s Center for Science and Culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the title “Nearly All of Evolution Is Best Explained by Engineering” &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2021/09/nearly-all-of-evolution-is-best-explained-by-engineering/&quot;&gt;his
post&lt;/a&gt; notes a
report that, as it describes “Transposable elements modify gene regulation in maize to confer drought tolerance,
alter flowering time, and enable plants to grow in toxic aluminum soils.”  He also mentions a number
of other cases in which organisms adapt rapidly in ways which seem to him to be the result
of their being engineered to do so.  His report is one in a series on a Conference on Engineering in
Living Systems (CELS) given in June and sponsored by the Engineering Research Group (ERG) of
the Center for Science &amp;amp; Culture of the Discovery Institute.  Proceedings of the CELS conference
seem not to be available online at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Miller, this seems to be evidence of the correctness of James Shapiro’s hypothesis of
Natural Genetic Engineering (NGE).  Shapiro’s view and many references to his summaries of it
can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_genetic_engineering&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article on NGE&lt;/a&gt;.
He thinks that organisms adapt by containing mechanisms that propose, not random genetic variation, but
the genetic variation that is specifically needed in the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among advocates of ID, this has been greeted with enthusiasm.  At Uncommon Descent, their in-house
science reporter “News” (Denyse O’Leary) made a similar comment about a report that reptile teeth
were gained multiple times in evolution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/evolution/reptiles-evolved-de-evolved-re-evolved-teeth/&quot;&gt;on
10/16/21&lt;/a&gt; she noted that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In short, when researchers actually looked at reptile tooth history, it was hardly a simple evolution tale at all. It seems as if there are plans that life forms can access, perhaps within their genomes. But how do they trigger the needed changes, as opposed to just going extinct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of natural genetic engineering that responds adaptively by making the needed changes in the
genome, rather than by having natural selection pick them out from among available variation, is wildly
popular among ID advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are a few questions that need to be raised …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does NGE mean that when an organism is stressed by an environmental change, or by lack of
resources, it has a higher rate of mutation, including genomic changes such as chromosome
rearrangements?  There are numerous reports of this.  Is this an adaptation, or simply
the mechanisms of replication functioning less exactly when the organism is stressed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are the mutants (including genomic changes) preferentially in an adaptive direction?  Or are
they, as usually happens, mostly neutral or deleterious?&lt;br /&gt;
Note that Brian Miller describes NGE by saying that
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;NGE refers to genetic alterations that are not random. Instead, they result from cells employing highly complex machinery to direct targeted DNA modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where is natural selection in all of this?  If a mutation arises which is adaptive, is its
increase in frequency in the population due to its fitness advantage?  Or does NGE somehow
continually push it up in frequency?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where in the genome is this mechanism?  And how does it know what the organism needs?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is it maintained intact in the face of mutation?  If the genetic variations it induces
spread, do they only continue to be present in individuals whose NGE system is intact?  If so
that would be a mechanism maintaining NGE.  But recombination should rapidly break down any such
association.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There also seems to be an interesting contradiction between the NGE view and current advocacy by
young earth creationists.  The YECs are strongly pushing the idea that there are basically no
advantageous mutations.  NGE seems to say that its marvellous mechanisms guarantee mostly
superbly beneficial mutations.  Can these two views be reconciled?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Miller, in EN&amp;amp;ST, actually goes so far as to declare that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Traditional evolutionary processes do play a part in biological adaptation, but mounting evidence demonstrates that their role is relatively minor in the drama of life …. Instead, engineered adaptive mechanisms that direct targeted modifications perform on center stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We await the answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">I try to keep up with the Discovery Institute’s site Evolution News and Science Today’.

in Science &amp;amp; Mathematics Education&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 25, no. 3, Fall, 2021.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If I had not been familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinaiandsynapses.org/&quot;&gt;Sinai and Synapses&lt;/a&gt;,* I might have dismissed this &lt;a href=&quot;https://ejrsme.icrsme.com/issue/view/1643/222&quot;&gt;special issue&lt;/a&gt; of an obscure journal as yet another attempt to use science to rationalize religious beliefs. It is nothing of the kind. The entire issue consists of essays by Fellows who have been supported over the years by the Sinai and Synapses organization, about which I have said a few words below, in an Endnote. The Fellows are experts in their fields and mostly faculty at secular universities. All of them, I am certain, know what they are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front matter contains helpful synopses of all the papers. Sometimes, I admit, the synopsis was all I wanted. I learned, however, that a second-century CE rabbi, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ha-Nasi&quot;&gt;Judah ha-Nasi&lt;/a&gt;, had noted that “pestilence” often transferred from pigs to humans, so Rabbi Judah recommended fasting whenever pigs suffered pestilence. I wondered why on earth such an influential rabbi would care one whit about pigs, so I naturally turned first to the article, “Zoonotic pandemics and Judaism’s early-modern turn to science,” by Jonathan Crane of Emory University. I was relieved to find that Rabbi Judah did not raise pigs, but he had nevertheless noted the similarity between pigs’ organs and humans’. More strikingly, he recognized that diseases could be contagious and could be transferred from pigs to humans. Rabbi Crane introduces us to later Talmudic scholars who, in addition to citing earlier scholars and relying on their expertise, adduced their own evidence and required confirmation. Specifically, medieval Jewish scholars such as Maimonides accepted the scientific knowledge of their day, and the early modern period found Jews embracing “exogenous knowledge as well as the emerging means to discover and develop it.” Rabbi Crane continues, “To be precise, scientific method and evidence matter when it comes to physical issues like medicine and public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I find this article important? Because if the ultra-Orthodox &lt;i&gt;Charedim&lt;/i&gt;, in both the United States and Israel, can be convinced that the sages accepted and indeed embraced the medical knowledge of their times and even understood zoonotic diseases, then we may have hope of getting them vaccinated and otherwise contributing to the battle against Covid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to convince people about scientific realities is not limited to the ultra-Orthodox. I next read the article, “Communicating with skeptical audiences,” by Matthew Groves. Mr. Groves is a high school science teacher and a faith educator who lives in rural Appalachia. His article primarily concerns convincing evangelicals of the reality of climate change. The data, as he says, are clear, “so how can people remain unconvinced?” He learned (slowly, I infer) to employ “the communication skills [he] developed as a teacher and a pastor and have found significant successes with audiences of all ages, denominations, and acceptance levels of climate science.” In short, language matters or, perhaps more precisely, terminology matters, and he has learned to strictly avoid technical terms and scientific jargon. The bottom line, to me, was somewhere in the middle of the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To get around [the vocabulary problem], oftentimes I completely avoid using these terms [climate change vs. global warming]. I often finish a full hour Sunday School class without using either, but end up in a place that’s much closer to where I want our conversation to culminate. We spend time talking about humanity’s relationship with God, each other, and nature, and therein I’ve been able to spark much more interesting conversations, which are fundamentally tied to climate change, than if I had started with throwing in those words initially and triggered someone’s sensitivities. If we can arrive at the conversations we want without tripping people up, all the better! This isn’t being dishonest, it’s just smarter communication. In my own work, if I walk into a church and trigger every audience member by leading with the climate-related issues that are sticking points for this community, no one will listen to me. This is true regardless of how central those tangential topics really are to solving the climate crisis – like its intersections with race, economics, gender, etc. When I plan my lessons, I think to myself: “&lt;i&gt;Here are the 8 words that will stop half of the audience from listening to me. How can I cover these concepts without saying those words?&lt;/i&gt;” [Italics in original.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Mr. Groves notes that people may be “alarmed, concerned, cautious, disengaged,
doubtful, [or] dismissive,” and his job is to move them up the ladder one rung at a time, not all in one jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I read the articles by Rabbi Crane and Mr. Groves, I began to wonder, in order to get through to religious conservatives, do you have to be one? Perhaps not, but it helps an awful lot to know how to sing the appropriate song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last article I have read, so far, at least, is “Overlapping magisteria: Motivated cognition and the places where science and religion mingle,” by Jonathan Morgan of the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. Prof. Morgan introduces Stephen Jay Gould’s concept of Non-Overlapping Magisteria, or Noma. Prof. Morgan argues that, if the magisteria do not overlap, then at a minimum they encroach on each other’s properties (a claim that I made myself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079332NDB&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The article is fairly dense and concentrates on areas where science may encroach on religion, as opposed to religion encroaching on science, which he says has been amply covered elsewhere. I will discuss only a very small part of it. The author devotes several paragraphs to free will, mostly demonstrating that a belief in free will may have practical consequences. Studying the consequences of believing in free will is not the same as asking whether we have it or not, but the author criticizes the studies for using science as a sort of default condition. I cannot disagree, though, that those of us who claim that we do or do not actually have free will may be leaving the domain of science and entering religion or philosophy, even as we think we are doing science. Are we engaging in motivated reasoning? Probably. Is it a problem? I will let Dr. Morgan explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;…when
science communicators venture onto metaphysical grounds, they risk threatening broad swaths of the
public who hold different theological views. …[W]hen people were presented with a highly credentialed scientist who was advocating for a position with which they disagreed, they were significantly less likely to rank that scientist as an expert. In other words, they did not dismiss the argument, they dismissed the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When science communicators are representing capital “S” Science while staking out
metaphysical disagreements with religious worldviews, they risk undermining a broader sense of trust
in the expertise of science. This is risky because there are plenty of other issues around which scientists
are making well-founded inferences that people may still dislike–evolution, climate change, and
vaccinations are among the most well studied. We make it more difficult for public buy-in on these
contentious issues when science communicators are also making threatening incursions onto terrain
where they cannot actually stand on solid empirical ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I think we can infer that the best people to talk to groups like vaccination, global warming, or evolution deniers are members of those groups or at least people who understand them implicitly. Then, to return to Mr. Groves’s categories, we work them up the ladder one rung at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will eventually read more of the articles and will comment only if I think they are important enough. In the meantime, any readers who want to read one or more of the contributions are invited to discuss them in the Comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*A word about &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinaiandsynapses.org/our-mission-and-methods/ &quot;&gt;Sinai and Synapses&lt;/a&gt;. I think it is fair to say that it is a religious organization that is interested in scientific inquiry. It has been “incubated” by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clal.org/&quot;&gt;Clal – The National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership&lt;/a&gt; and provides education and seminars. I have listened to a few interviews presided over by Geoffrey Mitelman and attended two or three sessions of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sinaiandsynapses.org/scientists-in-synagogues/&quot;&gt;Scientists in Synagogues&lt;/a&gt; and found them at least mildly interesting. Scientists in Synagogues is partly funded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.templeton.org/&quot;&gt;Templeton&lt;/a&gt;. I do not think Sinai and Synapses has any hidden agenda such as trying to mount a scientific defense of religion. And they have an exceedingly clever logo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2021/Offit_Cover_600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Book cover&quot; /&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently caught an &lt;a href=&quot;https://think.kera.org/2021/09/29/we-cant-have-medical-progress-without-risk/&quot;&gt;interview with Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of vaccinology and pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The interview, originally broadcast on KERA in Dallas, was moderated by Krys Boyd. Part of the purpose of the interview, obviously, was to sell his latest book, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/You-Bet-Your-Life-Transfusions/dp/1541620399&quot;&gt; You Bet Your Life&lt;/a&gt;: From Blood Transfusions to Mass Vaccination, the Long and Risky History of Medical Innovation&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get immediately to the point, Dr. Offit argues convincingly that there are no risk-free choices. If you choose not to be vaccinated, then you are choosing between the risk of contracting a deadly widespread disease (and, I might add, of infecting others) and the risk of suffering from a rare side effect. Why do people choose the common disease over the rare side effect? One reason, Dr. Offit claims, is that a sin of commission may be seen as a greater risk than a sin of omission, even if statistically it is not. Thus, you may feel guilt over a sin of commission but not over a sin of omission. Further, and equally regrettably, people see themselves and their children as invulnerable – “I am strong and healthy; it won’t happen to me” – and Dr. Offit attributes this kind of denialism to the unfortunate fact that the emotional centers evolved early, before what I shall call the thinking centers. He did not, according to my notes, discuss the political implications of refusing vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How safe are the Covid vaccines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccine trials typically involve 20-30,000 individuals. These individuals are observed carefully for 2 months, because historically the side effects occur within 2 months. The real question is the duration of the efficacy, and that requires a longer study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does he recommend the vaccine for everyone who is authorized to receive it? Yes, but only because we are in a pandemic, so the benefit of vaccination far outweighs the risk. If we were not in a pandemic, then he would not advise releasing the vaccine before it was fully approved by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the risks of waiting for full approval? Consider the polio vaccine. The vaccine was shown to be safe, potent, and effective. Yet during the trial 16 people died and 36 were paralyzed, of whom 34 were in the placebo group. Another way of looking at it, approximately 60 people were sacrificed in order to ensure the safety of the vaccine. Absent an epidemic like the polio epidemic, many fewer people would have suffered an adverse impact. We could, I presume, anticipate similar statistics if we wait for a Covid vaccine to be fully approved. You may hear additional anecdotes, including a discussion of the safety of the blood supply, in the full interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Offit also noted, and I cannot disagree, that the FDA failed us when (the arm of the FDA commisioner having been sufficiently twisted) it bowed to political pressure and approved hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma, even though they have been shown to be useless. In those cases, politics trumped science. We need the FDA, and I can only hope that its reputation has not been too badly damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, Dr. Offit considers the development of the Covid vaccines to be the greatest single medical accomplishment he has seen during his career: two safe, effective vaccines were developed a mere 11 months after the virus had been sequenced. Regarding safety, he stresses again that there are no risk-free choices, and in a fit of levity points out that even driving to the office to get the vaccine is not wholly safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">I recently caught an interview with Paul Offit, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of vaccinology and pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The interview, originally broadcast on KERA in Dallas, was moderated by Krys Boyd. Part of the purpose of the interview, obviously, was to sell his latest book, You Bet Your Life: From Blood Transfusions to Mass Vaccination, the Long and Risky History of Medical Innovation. To get immediately to the point, Dr. Offit argues convincingly that there are no risk-free choices. If you choose not to be vaccinated, then you are choosing between the risk of contracting a deadly widespread disease (and, I might add, of infecting others) and the risk of suffering from a rare side effect. Why do people choose the common disease over the rare side effect? One reason, Dr. Offit claims, is that a sin of commission may be seen as a greater risk than a sin of omission, even if statistically it is not. Thus, you may feel guilt over a sin of commission but not over a sin of omission. Further, and equally regrettably, people see themselves and their children as invulnerable – “I am strong and healthy; it won’t happen to me” – and Dr. Offit attributes this kind of denialism to the unfortunate fact that the emotional centers evolved early, before what I shall call the thinking centers. He did not, according to my notes, discuss the political implications of refusing vaccination. How safe are the Covid vaccines?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Iris pseudacorus</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/10/Iris-pseudacorus.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Iris pseudacorus" /><published>2021-10-11T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-10-11T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/10/Iris-pseudacorus</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/10/Iris-pseudacorus.html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note added 14 October 2021, 6:40 p.m. MDT: Professor Braterman has published an expanded version of this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://paulbraterman.wordpress.com/2021/10/14/tall-el-hammam-an-airburst-of-gullibility-it-gets-worse/&quot;&gt;Tall el-Hammam; an airburst of gullibility; it gets worse&lt;/a&gt;, in the blog Primate’s Progress.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared the excitement when I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that “in ~ 1650 BCE (~ 3600 years ago), a cosmic airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam, a Middle-Bronze-Age city in the southern Jordan Valley northeast of the Dead Sea,” and that this event could have given rise to the biblical account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Somewhat to my surprise, Ken Ham of &lt;i&gt;Answers in Genesis&lt;/i&gt; did not. I now think that Ken’s conclusion [1] was right and I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I suspect many of the journalists and interested readers who swooped on this story, I failed at first to notice that the paper was not, despite the link, an article in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; but in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;. This is one of the stable of second-line journals closely linked to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; being published by Springer, now controlled by the publishing giant Hotlzbrinck, and profiting from &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;’s reputation for excellence. I was only vaguely aware of the authors’ long history of invoking airbursts, took the many kinds of evidence listed at face value, and did not even blink at the claim that “[a]n airburst-related influx of salt (~ 4 wt.%) produced hypersalinity,” a process for which I can envisage no credible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have since described this work to a much larger audience in &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/a-giant-space-rock-demolished-an-ancient-middle-eastern-city-and-everyone-in-it-possibly-inspiring-the-biblical-story-of-sodom-167678&quot;&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, where they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w&quot;&gt;repeat their claim&lt;/a&gt;, also published in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, of a similar catastrophe at Abu Hureyra in what is now Syria, around 10,800 BCE, assert that “it almost certainly won’t be the last time a human city meets this fate,” claim that such events “pose a severe modern-day hazard,” and advise that “unless orbiting or ground-based telescopes detect these rogue objects, the world may have no warning, just like the people of Tall el-Hammam.” The Abu Hureya paper also repeats &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_hypothesis&quot;&gt;a litany of earlier claims&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas&quot;&gt;Younger Dryas&lt;/a&gt;, a period of severe cold in the northern hemisphere from around 12,900 to 11,700  years Before Present [Present is fixed at 1950 CE], was caused by a  series of impacts with cometary debris, spread over at least four continents. These claims have been severely disputed; see papers listed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prominent among the critics is my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Boslough&quot;&gt;Mark Boslough&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on such cataclysmic events who even has an asteroid named after him. He tells me that he is tired of repeated rebuttal of what he considers to be obviously false claims, and of seeing his own theoretical analysis of the effect of airbursts invoked as an explanation of claims completely inconsistent with such a process, or perhaps any credible process. For this reason, rather than publishing yet another counterblast that will be ignored, he has taken to describing the controversy, extending over many years, on Twitter (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/1440097126856282113&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/1440378973309968391&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequent threads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous reasons for concern about the Tall el-Hammam paper in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper tells us, “The project is under the aegis of the School of Archaeology, Veritas International University, Santa Ana, CA, and the College of Archaeology, Trinity Southwest University, Albuquerque, NM, under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://viu.ves.edu/doctrinal-statement/&quot;&gt;Veritas International University believes in&lt;/a&gt; “the full historicity and comprehensibility of the biblical record.” It is accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), which I have written about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2013/11/credit-where-none-is-due-creationist-colleges-and-courses-i-am-browsing-school-science-textbooks-pub.html&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. Trinity Southwest University, which now operates from an office in a strip mall in Albuquerque, was formerly in Tulsa, Oklahoma, under the name Southwest Biblical Seminary, and rejects any government accreditation whatsoever as intrusive violation of the separation of Church and State. While the traditional site of Sodom is in Israel (and within the pre-1967 boundaries), Tall el-Hammam is in Jordan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corresponding author is Allen West, who has been publishing prolifically in this area since 2005 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6434d1px&quot;&gt;Evidence for the Extinction of Mammoths by an Extraterrestrial Impact Event&lt;/a&gt;) and in 2006 co-authored a book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=d1ooDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PT14&amp;amp;dq=%22Allen+West%22&amp;amp;ots=9QLiSjyrE3&amp;amp;sig=6pEWeeRLpuPRJeGozdWInxrMUsw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Allen%20West%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes: How a Stone-Age Comet Changed the Course of World Culture&lt;/a&gt;, which claims  that the debris of a shattered comet was responsible for  “a cosmic chain of events [that] began 41,000 years ago and culminated in a major global  catastrophe  28,000 years later.” These events include everything from the extinction of the mammoths to the landform of the Carolina Bays to the legend of Atlantis to a purported “mysterious layer of black sediment” found spanning North America to the Younger Dryas discussed in the Abu Hureya paper.  West has no academic qualifications or affiliations and gives his address as Comet Research Group (CRG), Prescott, Arizona (several of the other authors are also members of this group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/&quot;&gt;which is linked&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authortalk.audio/&quot;&gt;Rising Light Group&lt;/a&gt;, a 501(c)3, tax-exempt charitable organization with a clear Christian and biblical agenda, registered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authortalk.audio/501-c3.html&quot;&gt;Allen West’s name&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt; University of Wyoming archaeologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/SUROVELL/&quot;&gt;Todd Surovell&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues couldn’t find increased magnetic spherules representing cosmic debris at seven &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/106/43/18155.abstract?sid=49d79c32-625b-4cdd-bbb2-3ff3254f8a46&quot;&gt;Clovis sites&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geology.siu.edu/people/pinter/index.html&quot;&gt;Nicholas Pinter&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues at Southern Illinois University Carbondale argue the carbon spherules are organic residue of fungus or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2010GL043345.shtml&quot;&gt;arthropod excrement&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://physics.wustl.edu/people/daulton_tyrone-l&quot;&gt;Tyrone Daulton&lt;/a&gt; of Washington University in St. Louis and his colleagues reported that supposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16043&quot;&gt;nanodiamonds formed by the impact were misidentified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous other concerns specific to the present work &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143&quot;&gt;have been presented&lt;/a&gt; at PubPeer, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/&quot;&gt;very detailed concerns&lt;/a&gt; have been raised by Elisabeth Bik in her blog, Science Integrity Digest, where she presents evidence that images in the paper had been manipulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in an acrimonious exchange with me in the Comments section of &lt;i&gt;The Conversation&lt;/i&gt;, Wells pointed out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our group included, among many others: Dr. James Kennett, emeritus professor at UCSB, specializing in stratigraphy, micropaleontology, paleobiology. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, which recognizes the contributions of just 0.1% of all scientists. Dr. Ted Bunch, former NASA section chief and a world-leading meteoriticist. Dr. Robert Hermes, retired from Los Alamos National Labs, world-recognized expert in trinitite or atomic glass. Dr. Wendy Wolbach, chemistry professor who discovered high-temperature soot at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied with a listing of some papers that I have examined criticising West’s own earlier work regarding airbursts, including sampling techniques and claimed evidence for very high temperatures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Though not his reasoning, Ken’s argument is based on his Ussher-style &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/how-does-mans-history-fit-with-the-biblical-timeline/&quot;&gt;biblical timeline&lt;/a&gt;, which places the call of Abraham at 1922 BCE, whereas the destruction of Tall el-Hammam is dated to ~ 1650 BCE. For what it’s worth (not much, I know), this disagreement would disappear if we use, instead, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BCE for the Creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot; &quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not read Stephen Meyer’s new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G122JJN/&quot;&gt;Return of the God Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, subtitled “Three Scientific Discoveries That Reveal the Mind Behind the Universe,” and possibly will not. I had not been aware that the God hypothesis had ever gone away, and 700-odd pages of what looks like old hat seems perhaps a bit excessive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, what may look to some like an unlikely source, the right-wing blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(website)&quot;&gt;Ricochet&lt;/a&gt;, may have saved me the trouble: They recently ran a splendid “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ricochet.com/1059644/stephen-meyers-return-of-the-god-hypothesis/&quot;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt;” of the book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1535406429/clearer-thinking-with-spencer-greenberg/liberalism-and-conservatism-with-cassandra-xia-and-hank-racette&quot;&gt;Henry Racette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. Racette, the book stands on three pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The universe had a beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The universe is fine-tuned for life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The genetic code is evidence of an intelligent designer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Racette considers the fine-tuning argument to be the strongest of the three. Nevertheless, he ultimately dismisses it and wisely invokes the God of the Gaps before concluding,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Meyer has written a book that could have been written at any time during our long quest for understanding. The details would change, the sophistication would vary, but the product would be similar: a man standing on the edge of the unknown surveys the wisest men around him and concludes that, since they have no wholly satisfactory answers, one or another god is the most plausible explanation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I shall have no need to read this book, since Mr. Racette has done so for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledgment.&lt;/strong&gt; I am indebted to several colleagues, who provided some links and a brief discussion of Mr. Racette’s review.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">I have not read Stephen Meyer’s new book, Return of the God Hypothesis, subtitled “Three Scientific Discoveries That Reveal the Mind Behind the Universe,” and possibly will not. I had not been aware that the God hypothesis had ever gone away, and 700-odd pages of what looks like old hat seems perhaps a bit excessive. Fortunately, what may look to some like an unlikely source, the right-wing blog Ricochet, may have saved me the trouble: They recently ran a splendid “critique” of the book by Henry Racette. According to Mr. Racette, the book stands on three pillars:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bubo virginianus</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/09/bubo-virginianus.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bubo virginianus" /><published>2021-09-27T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-09-27T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/09/bubo-virginianus</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/09/bubo-virginianus.html">&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;David Young&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guest post by &lt;strong&gt;Dan Phelps&lt;/strong&gt;, to whom we are indebted for unearthing this whopper from Answers in Genesis:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, creationists are misrepresenting a recent dinosaur discovery. This time it is a large carcharodontosaur from Uzbekistan that was recently described in a paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210923&quot;&gt;A new carcharodontosaurian theropod dinosaur occupies apex predator niche in the early Late Cretaceous of Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt;, by Kohei Tanaka and colleagues from the universities of Tsukuba, Hokkaido, and Calgary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On today’s “Answers News,” an online news video by Answers in Genesis, their employees (including Ken Ham’s son-in-law, Bodie Hodge) discuss this dinosaur. The discussion can be found from about 9 minutes, 30 seconds to about 14 minutes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/4Jhf2eKXwAc&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; YouTube video.  As is par for the course, they ignore the actual publication and rely instead on popular press discussions such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2021/9/9/22664700/tyrannosaurus-rex-ulughbegsaurus-uzbekistanensis-bigger-dinosaur&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; . They also add their bizarre creationist interpretations and claim the fossil was buried in Noah’s Flood. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more ridiculously, they suggest the theropod dinosaur – the apex predator! – may have been a vegetarian. This would be amusing except that AIG is misinforming children and adults via such broadcasts as above, the Creation “Museum,” and their Kentucky-taxpayer–subsidized “Ark Encounter.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Carcharodontosaurus reconstruction.
