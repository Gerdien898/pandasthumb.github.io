&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A geranium plant that I supposedly take care of has a serious infestation with whiteflies. Before dousing the plant with insecticidal soap (a procedure I am supposed to follow every week for a while), I snapped the preceding picture. There is a lot of there there, so I asked Mark Sturtevant exactly what I am looking at. His response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spiky things are a weird part of the life cycle of whiteflies. Although they are in the order Hemiptera, which are 'supposed' to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/incomplete-metamorphosis/&quot;&gt;incomplete metamorphosis&lt;/a&gt; (passing thru nymphal stages before molting into adults), whiteflies are hemipterans that essentially have a larval stage and pupal stage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/complete-metamorphosis/&quot;&gt;holometabolous&lt;/a&gt; insects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see quite a bit going on here in this one picture. I have re-attached your picture with some annotations.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if there are eggs in view. The tiny white specks look more like glandular secretions from the leaf. But there are a few larvae along the top border of the picture, and I have marked some with an L.  You see the pupal stage already (one is marked with a P), but technically these are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/puparium/&quot;&gt;puparia&lt;/a&gt;. When a larva becomes a pupa, the larva usually sheds its cuticle to show the pupa underneath, with its own cuticle. But in whiteflies (and in some other insects like flies and fleas), the larva does not shed its cuticle. Rather, it puffs it out, hardens it, and the pupal stage stays locked inside the larval cuticle. That outer larval shell is called the puparium. Then there are the adults. The large adults are females, and I have marked one with an F. Males are smaller and much more active. Winged males fly and seek out females. I think the one labelled M is a male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the day was warm, and there were lots of males on the window trying to get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Dr. Sturtevant about the transparent spheres that clutter the frame:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't know what the big spheres are, but it could be like aphids (whiteflies are related to them) which periodically secrete a drop of honeydew. This is excess water from plant sap, and aphids secrete that to concentrate the nutrients. Since whiteflies are always secreting a waxy bloom, a thin wax coating on their honeydew droplets would hold them together. That's a hypothesis, but I don't really know. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Trialeurodes vaporariorum &amp;ndash; greenhouse whiteflies infesting a geranium leaf.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imperial College has decided not to rename the Huxley Building, in a partial victory for those who oppose “canceling” historical figures who held views that today are properly regarded as racist. Instead, according to an article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/234096/imperial-commits-ambitious-understanding-history/&quot;&gt;Imperial commits to ‘ambitious understanding’ of history&lt;/a&gt;, by Deborah Evanson, they will add a second, joint name to the building, in addition to that of Thomas H. Huxley. The second name will be that of “a pathbreaking scientist from a Black, Asian or other minority ethnic background.” The College will also retain a bust of Huxley, but will put Huxley and his accomplishments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;into a fuller context in order to provide everyone with a more complete understanding of Huxley’s complex character and achievements as well as his flaws, including his racially prejudiced writings. Historical context will also be provided for any person whose name is added jointly.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huxley, like most of us, was indeed a complex character. He no doubt thought that white, male Englishmen were generally smarter than everyone else. In that respect he was no different from most white, male Englishmen of his time. Nevertheless, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/12/Matzke-Huxley-comments.html&quot;&gt;an article by Nick Matzke and others&lt;/a&gt; on Panda’s Thumb last December, Huxley devoted himself to educating women and poor people, and actively opposed slavery; he was thus well in advance of many, if not most, of his contemporaries. It is gratifying that Imperial College recognizes this progressive leader and has decided not to dename the Huxley Building because of a flaw that was widely shared in his era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biologist and blogger Jerry Coyne calls the compromise “&lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/02/25/a-small-victory-thomas-henry-huxley-not-cancelled-but-contextualized-at-imperial-college/&quot;&gt;a small victory&lt;/a&gt;,” and I suppose it is.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, February 18, I attended (on Zoom) a fascinating seminar given by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/p-kilmartin&quot;&gt;Paul Kilmartin, Professor of Chemistry&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-chemical-sciences.html&quot;&gt;School of Chemical Sciences&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html&quot;&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, here in Aotearoa/New Zealand. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/nmat471&quot;&gt;I work&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-biological-sciences.html&quot;&gt;School of Biological Sciences&lt;/a&gt; at the same institution.) Prof. Kilmartin specialises in wine chemistry, among other things, and in addition to chemistry, has degrees in theology and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kilmartin’s talk was entitled &lt;b&gt;“Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori: A Conversation.”&lt;/b&gt; Kilmartin has given me permission to quote this part of his talk, below, which covers science education material of international interest. I will also include the talk summary. Other parts of Kilmartin’s seminar focused on his own background coming to this issue (Scottish and Māori ancestry, member of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/&quot;&gt;Ngāi Tahu&lt;/a&gt;, deep knowledge of Ngāi Tahu history and land claims), and ideas for Auckland’s chemistry program to explore regarding mātauranga Māori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Panda’s Thumb blog has an international readership interested in science and science education, and I have been involved with science education controversies for 20 years (and with PT for 18!). But I’m sure the NZ situation is new to many readers. Therefore, I will give some background/introduction to the controversy around the science curriculum, after the quote from Kilmartin’s talk.  For more (much more) on current science education controversies in New Zealand, please search &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.google.com/search?q=science%2C%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;amp;hl=en-NZ&amp;amp;gl=NZ&amp;amp;ceid=NZ%3Aen&quot;&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=science%20%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/?s=mauri+zealand&amp;amp;orderby=relevance&amp;amp;order=DESC&amp;amp;post_type=post&quot;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; etc. on the various terms mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Please not that all of non-talk material is written by me, and should not necessarily be taken as Kilmartin’s views. And, these are my personal views, not those of current or former employers.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
[Seminar given on Zoom by Prof. Paul Kilmartin at 2022-02-18 at 11 am.]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[Around 27 minutes in, Kilmartin continues...]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second Ministry of Education text I would like to comment upon concerns proposals for NCEA science. The courses here involve so-called Big Ideas, and the inclusions of concepts drawn from Mātauranga Māori.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;
These were proposed last year for inclusion in the NCEA curriculum, and have been piloted in some schools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I understand that this year, a further 5 schools will be involved in mini-pilots, with full pilots to take place next year, and full implementation by 2024.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the Big Ideas in the Chemistry area has to do with the properties of matter, as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin1.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what is mauri? Its definition is important for teachers and students alike. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following Glossary is provided, where mauri is defined as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin2.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[Then follows several minutes of discussion of various definitions and usages of the mauri concept; Kilmartin states that insofar as mauri is used to refer to a concept like individual or ecosystem health, he can work with it.  Kilmartin also discusses Prof. T.K.K.B. Morgan's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mauriometer.com/&quot;&gt;mauri-o-meter&lt;/a&gt;, etc.]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[Resume at about minute 33:00]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But is there more to the concept of mauri than this?  In an earlier publication, within a civil engineers' proceeding, Prof. Morgan provides more background to mauri. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin3.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And there are some new concepts here. Not only do all natural objects possess it, mauri is seen as the binding force between the physical and the spiritual. Indeed, when mauri is impacted and the bond weakened, the physical and the spiritual are separated, leading to death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One question is whether using mauri in the sense of life-supporting capacity implies all of this additional meaning.  If it does, then I would want to ask, Who discovered this binding force between the physical and the spiritual?  And what evidence was involved in its discovery? If this binding force is real, then everyone needs to know about it. It needs to be in the chemistry syllabus of every country, not just in New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So how has this new syllabus been received by teachers? We have one publication on this topic from last year [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.46786/ac21.1591&quot;&gt;Stewart and Tedoldi 2021&lt;/a&gt;], which explains that the inclusion of Māori concepts is an attempt to reflect the principal of equal mana, mana ōrite, for Māori knowledge -- one of the seven principles within the NCEA Change package, announced by the government in May 2019.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin4.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also learn that these proposals have sparked heated discussions, in which NCEA science teachers have referred to Māori knowledge as &quot;myths and legends,&quot; or &quot;’spiritual concepts’ that do not belong in the science curriculum.&quot; Well, good on the teachers for having their say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The authors of this article [&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.46786/ac21.1591&quot;&gt;Stewart and Tedoldi 2021&lt;/a&gt;] have other views. The problem with the teachers is seen as a narrow understanding of what is living, as taught under the &quot;MRS GREN&quot; life processes: Movement, Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Reproduction, Excretion, and Nutrition, and I remember teaching MRS GREN in my two years as a secondary school teacher in Christchurch in the early 90s.  Instead this should be expanded to consider a river as living. To support this understanding, teachers are recommended to look to the Gaia concept of the Earth as a living thing. I hadn't heard much about Gaia recently, and it was much more popular in the 80s and 90s, and I might be showing my age here.  I had to look up Wikipedia for some recent information. There is every indication that Gaia has little current following in the scientific community, after some years of more active debate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One final example of mauri is of interest to myself as an electrochemist, given our use of electricity to interface with chemistry.  And this relates to domestic electrical wiring. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worksafe.govt.nz/dmsdocument/1580-new-zealand-electrical-code-of-practice-for-homeowneroccupiers-electrical-wiring-work-in-domestic-installations-nzecp-51-2004&quot;&gt;current New Zealand Electrical Code of Practice&lt;/a&gt;, we are encouraged to think of the Green/Yellow=Earth wire as a Papatuanuku or Earth Mother. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Kilmartin5.png&quot; style=&quot;width:75%&quot; class=&quot;centerImage&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I must admit, I do have trouble taking this seriously, and I doubt the use of tapu and noa in this matter matches their meaning within Mātauranga Māori.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My own view is that the concept of mauri has no place in the Chemistry curriculum. I would suggest to re-write the Big Idea along these lines:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The NCEA Education web-site provides the following material for the “Big Idea” named “Properties of matter are determined by attractive forces between particles”, prepared for teaching Chemistry and Biology as a consolidated subject at Curriculum level 6 (NCEA 1):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mauri is present in all matter. All particles have their own mauri and presence as part of a larger whole, for example within a molecule, polymer, salt, or metal. When matter is broken into smaller particles each particle remains as part of the taiao [environment], for example when a substance is burnt or dissolved the particles remain, with their own mauri.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A glossary definition of mauri is also provided:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The vital essence, life force of everything: be it a physical object, living thing or ecosystem. In Chemistry and Biology, mauri refers to the health and life-sustaining capacity of the taiao, on biological, physical, and chemical levels.&lt;br /&gt;

This presentation will provide a personal perspective on several issues related to Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori. These will include selected points from Ngāi Tahu/family history, through to a critique of recent Ministry of Education publications where Mātauranga Māori concepts are being brought into the School curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick Backgrounder for international readers (by Matzke)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;i&gt;mātauranga Māori&lt;/i&gt; means Māori knowledge.  (It is often just “mātauranga” when the context is obvious; it is often also abbreviated MM.) Often this primarily refers to traditional indigenous knowledge, but it can also include newer knowledge that was developed or incorporated more recently.  Much more detail is available via google, see for example the Māori dictionary and mātauranga Māori and science, from the NZ Science Learning Hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hired in NZ in 2018, and I have gradually learned of a widespread movement to promote MM at all levels. For example, it is an aspect of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/agencies-policies-and-budget-initiatives/vision-matauranga-policy/&quot;&gt;Vision Mātauranga&lt;/a&gt;, the governmental strategy for encouraging scientific research that benefits Māori interests. It is promoted in university strategic plans, and in school systems.  All of this is motivated by many honorable values. I cannot list them all, but motivations include everything from (1) making science education and research more interesting and relevant to Māori students, through to (2) encouraging Māori cultural advancement and renewal (much like government promotion of te reo Māori, the Māori language) – especially important to help repair damaged caused by colonisation, through to (3) economic and conservation benefits that could accrue from deploying traditional knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is well and good, and it is hard to see how anyone could reasonably object to these ideas in general. However, specifics and implementation matter a lot, and controversy has recently arisen over a governmental policy to revise the school curriculum with guideline mandating “parity” between “Western science” and mātauranga Māori. In July 2021, seven professors (full or emeritus) from the University of Auckland wrote a letter to a NZ magazine, &lt;i&gt;The Listener&lt;/i&gt;, objecting to this and other Ministry of Education statements. The initial reaction was swift and harshly negative, as some perceived the letter as denigrating mātauranga.  But over time a more normal public discussion ensued in &lt;i&gt;The Listener&lt;/i&gt; and elsewhere (which is ongoing), and now the Vice Chancellor of the University of Auckland, Dawn Freshwater, has stated “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/auckland-plans-dialogue-maori-knowledge-and-science&quot;&gt;Nobody is wrong here&lt;/a&gt;,” and promised to host an academic symposium to thoroughly discuss the various issues raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The symposium was going to be in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/auckland-plans-dialogue-maori-knowledge-and-science&quot;&gt;first quarter of 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but now the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has slipped through quarantine, and NZ is experiencing it’s first huge wave of SARS-CoV-2. I say SARS-CoV-2, because NZ is highly vaccinated and omicron is milder, so hopefully we will avoid most of the actual Covid disease. In any case, the University of Auckland is online-only (mostly) for at least the first half of Semester 1, so I imagine the symposium will likely be delayed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not involved in &lt;i&gt;The Listener&lt;/i&gt; controversy, except to try to defend the principle of academic freedom of everyone involved. To me, the word “parity” could mean a lot of things, NZ generally seems like a place where common sense prevails (rather than everything going to the nuclear option of litigation or political polarisation, as occurs in the USA), and in any case I’m just a recent immigrant, lucky to be here. It seemed to me that the whole debate needed to happen in long-form (rather than letters, petitions, and tweets) where issues can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/448453/let-s-choose-our-words-more-carefully-when-discussing-matauranga-maori-and-science&quot;&gt;discussed thoroughly&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps now this will happen in the VC’s Symposium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there has been a new development. The NZ Ministry of Education’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/&quot;&gt;NCEA (“National Certificate of Educational Achievement”)&lt;/a&gt; released its curricula for a &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;variety of classes at NCEA Level 1&lt;/a&gt; (translation: students approximately age 15-16). NCEA Levels 2 and 3 are essentially university preparatory material, and include high-stakes exams run by NZQA, relevant for credits for University admissions. Level 1 is more basic material, and some students choose to skip Level 1 to go straight to higher levels, but the “NCEA Change Process” will move to Levels 2 and 3 when NCEA Level 1 changes are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NCEA Level 1 includes classes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/chemistry-and-biology?view=learning&quot;&gt;Chemistry and Biology&lt;/a&gt; (CB), general &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/science?view=learning&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt; (SC), &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/physics-earth-and-space-science?view=learning&quot;&gt;Physics Earth and Space Science&lt;/a&gt; (PESS), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/mathematics-and-statistics/mathematics-and-statistics?view=learning&quot;&gt;Mathematics and Statistics&lt;/a&gt; (MS). Reviewing the curricula, some of it, including some of the mātauranga Māori content, seems fine, or at least not something to raise a public ruckus about. (E.g., the curriculum is often pretty vague and general, but NZ deliberately decided to not create hyper-detailed curricula like the 1000+ page curricula used in Australia.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some of it is…very surprising. The example that leapt out to me is also the section that Kilmartin critiqued: the chemistry discussion of atoms, molecules, chemical bonds, and conservation of mass/energy/the First Law of Thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some quick translations for the international reader. Please see the NCEA glossary or other online resources for more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ākonga&lt;/b&gt; = students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;taiao&lt;/b&gt; = the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;kaitiakitanga&lt;/b&gt; = guardianship and protection, e.g. of the environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;whakapapa&lt;/b&gt; = genealogy framework used to record relationships (genealogical or otherwise), but more generally, it is often used to refer to heritage, inheritance, cultural and familial connections, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;mauri&lt;/b&gt; (quoting from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncea.education.govt.nz/science/chemistry-and-biology?view=subject-glossary&quot;&gt;NCEA Glossary&lt;/a&gt;) = &quot;The vital essence, life force of everything: be it a physical object, living thing or ecosystem. In Chemistry and Biology, mauri refers to the health and life-sustaining capacity of the taiao, on biological, physical, and chemical levels.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NCEA Chemistry and Biology curriculum says (or said as of November 2021, if they change it, which they eventually will have to):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big Idea: Properties of matter are determined by attractive forces between particles&lt;/b&gt;

Mauri is present in all matter. All particles have their own mauri and presence as part of a larger whole, for example within a molecule, polymer, salt, or metal. When matter is broken into smaller particles each particle remains as part of the taiao, for example when a substance is burnt or dissolved the particles remain, with their own mauri. They do not just disappear.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is meant by “mauri” here?  We might avoid conflict by imagining that the term is being used here to refer to individual or ecosystem health, as it is some other places in the curriculum. Elsewhere in his talk, Kilmartin notes that concepts of health are something that he can work with as a scientist, and I agree. For example, a toxin might damage an individual organism, chemical pollution might damage an ecosystem, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that interpretation cannot be applied to this Big Idea. For starters, virtually all matter in the Universe has zero to do with health of living things, because it is outside of our solar system. Even if we stretch the health interpretation to some science fiction scenario where humans and other Earth organisms have escaped our solar system, most of the relevance of various “particles” to organismal/ecosystem health is not due just to the particles’ properties; we must also consider their temperature, arrangement, relative amounts, and the needs of the various organisms. Methane in large amounts is toxic to humans, healthy to certain microorganisms, and deadly to all of them on Titan where the temperature is -179.6 degrees Celsius on a hot day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in any event, whatever “life-sustaining” capacity of a particle we might imagine, it decidedly does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; remain upon being burnt. Oxygen (O2) is necessary for human life, but carbon dioxide (CO2), the product of burning carbon-containing compounds like methane in oxygen, is toxic at sufficient levels.  If by “particles”, the NCEA actually meant “atoms”, (a) they should have just said that, and (b) while the “atom” interpretation does refer to something that doesn’t change upon burning, understanding atomic properties is fairly remote from understanding health impacts, which mostly concern how molecules interact with organismal processes, and (c) the term “particles” explicitly refers to “molecule, polymer, salt, or metal” in the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage does not make sense if interpreted as referring to health impacts. What we are left with is the more fundamental definition of mauri, which is closer to its original usage anyway, which is the “vital essence, life force of everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the concept of a life force or vital essence is…vitalism!  And vitalism is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/vitalism&quot;&gt;very old&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6208063/&quot;&gt;very very discredited&lt;/a&gt; idea. Wohler’s 1828 synthesis of urea from inorganic compounds, when it was previously thought to be an organic molecule produced only by life, was later recognized as an early episode in the defeat of vitalism, and is cited in virtually all chemistry textbooks and classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note that, as is always the case when the history of science is explored in depth, the history is more complex than the defeat of vitalism in a single experiment. Vitalism was an amorphous doctrine, not refutable by a single experiment, but it died a gradual death by many cuts, as experiments accumulated that synthesized various organic compounds from inorganic sources. See Ramberg 2000.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern chemistry and biology, especially organic chemistry and biochemistry, essentially arose through the examination and experimental defeat of vitalism, including the defeat of many rear-guard attempts to defend some reduced version of the concept of a life force or life essence – something “extra” beyond material matter and forces which gave living things the breath of life. To have some government bureaucrats try to bring it back into chemistry by administrative declaration is not going to fly.  Seeing vitalism in chemistry standards is as surprising as it would be to see a Geology curriculum endorse Noah’s Flood or the idea that the Earth is 6,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;other_problems&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Other problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems should have been obvious, and they certainly were to the many science teachers who objected. Unfortunately, science teachers’ objections seem to be being hand-waved away by the educational establishment, for example by &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.46786/ac21.1591&quot;&gt;Stewart &amp;amp; Tedoldi (2021)&lt;/a&gt;, who seem to be closely involved with the science curricula. They note the strong objections that science teachers voiced to bringing mauri into the Chemistry/Biology curriculum in this way, but they reply by bringing up…Gaia. Even if one ignored Kilmartin’s point, namely that the Gaia Hypothesis is itself controversial, Gaia aims to explain how the Earth is a homeostatic system; it doesn’t solve the problems with trying to bring back vitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are other huge problems with the inclusion of mauri in the discussion of particles, chemical bonds, and conservation of mass.  These include: What will be on the exams? Will one question be a chemical formula, and the next a spiritual concept?  Won’t the inclusion of spiritual concepts in amongst basic chemistry concepts create conflict in the classroom between students (or teachers) with differing spiritual views? Is this even authentic mātauranga, or is it actually something hatched in the bowels of the Ministry of Education in mid-2021 in the service of some goal other than science education? And, especially, how did all of this get pushed through over negative reviews that the Ministry must have gotten from scientists and science teachers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Also, where is the “e-word”, evolution? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=avoiding+the+e-word%2C+evolution&amp;amp;oq=avoiding+the+e-word%2C+evolution&quot;&gt;Avoiding the e-word in Biology curricula is often a warning sign in itself.&lt;/a&gt; Perhaps the idea is that it can be replaced with the concept of whakapapa, but everything I’ve heard suggests it is wildly oversimplified and basically wrong to equate evolution/phylogeny with whakapapa. But perhaps the Ministry of Education thinks it can just declare they are the same.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a rather profound meta-issue that keeps arising in these discussions, namely, “Who has the authority to speak?”  Professor Kilmartin (in a part of the talk I did not quote) argues strongly that everyone should be allowed to participate in the discussion – scientists, mātauranga Māori experts, and the general public whose children will be educated under these curricula in the schools. I agree, but there is another point worth making. When the subject is a public school curriculum, we should keep in mind the &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; of such curricula: to get everyone on the same page, to supply the basic concepts and definitions and will be taught. If an introductory curriculum requires a complex hermeneutic to correctly interpret it, or if advanced knowledge is required to understand it, then the curriculum is failing at its basic purpose. Being simple and clear, providing a common baseline for everyone, is the &lt;i&gt;whole point&lt;/i&gt; of a curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this post is long enough as it is, so these other questions will have to wait for future posts. I do encourage others concerned about the situation with science standards in New Zealand to get in touch (nickmatzke@gmail.com); the way that problems like this can get solved is by activism.&lt;/p&gt;

On Friday, February 18, I attended (on Zoom) a fascinating seminar given by Paul Kilmartin, Professor of Chemistry in the School of Chemical Sciences at the University of Auckland, here in Aotearoa/New Zealand. (I work in the School of Biological Sciences at the same institution.) Prof. Kilmartin specialises in wine chemistry, among other things, and in addition to chemistry, has degrees in theology and philosophy. Kilmartin’s talk was entitled “Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori: A Conversation.” Kilmartin has given me permission to quote this part of his talk, below, which covers science education material of international interest. I will also include the talk summary. Other parts of Kilmartin’s seminar focused on his own background coming to this issue (Scottish and Māori ancestry, member of Ngāi Tahu, deep knowledge of Ngāi Tahu history and land claims), and ideas for Auckland’s chemistry program to explore regarding mātauranga Māori. The Panda’s Thumb blog has an international readership interested in science and science education, and I have been involved with science education controversies for 20 years (and with PT for 18!). But I’m sure the NZ situation is new to many readers. Therefore, I will give some background/introduction to the controversy around the science curriculum, after the quote from Kilmartin’s talk. For more (much more) on current science education controversies in New Zealand, please search Google News, Twitter, blogs etc. on the various terms mentioned. (Please not that all of non-talk material is written by me, and should not necessarily be taken as Kilmartin’s views. And, these are my personal views, not those of current or former employers.)

&lt;p&gt;On January 11, Matt Young reported that the Institute for Creation Science announced a new logo that depicted left-handed DNA. Although regularly occurring in vivo in the form of Z-DNA left-handed DNA only represent a very tiny proportion of the world’s DNA which consists predominantly of right-handed B-DNA as Watson and Crick described it in their 1954 paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICR left-handed DNA logo made it on the pages of &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.fred.net/tds/leftdna/&quot;&gt;Tom Schneider’s Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; immediately and became the sites first entry in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Institute for Creation Research has created a new logo representing their support for left handed DNA research and the ongoing takeover! First reported on 2022 Jan 11, new as of 2022 Jan 112&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases depicting DNA left-handed will be caused by mirroring a correct picture to better suit design purposes or likely more often by copying publicly available pictures. The same may be true for the ICR logo. Still, the incident reminded me of the likely first ever publicly displayed left-handed DNA model that was part of the Science Exhibition at the Seattle World Fair in 1962 which I came across when I studied the history of a right-handed DNA model Max Delbrück purchased for the Institute of Genetics of the University of Cologne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spl.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/singleitem/image/p15015coll3/523/default.jpg&quot;&gt;There were two DNA models on display in the exhibition&lt;/a&gt;, a right-handed ball and stick model and a left-handed abstract model which depicted the four bases of DNA as poker card suits (diamonds, spades, clubs and hearts) adopting a presentation of nucleotides George Gamow used in a 1955 &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; article (1). Both models can be seen in the promotional film &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/iNMpy2dbEgE&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Century 21 Calling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; starting at 3:33.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Gamow learned about the double helix structure of DNA he suggested a model by which DNA could encode protein sequences. It turned out later that this model was completely wrong (since the intermediate messenger- and transfer-RNA involved in protein synthesis were unknown back then he assumed a direct interaction between DNA and amino acids during the formation of protein chains), but he suggested that a code of triplets of bases of DNA would be sufficient to encode the 20 proteinogenic amino acids. This idea was adopted by Crick who together with Sydney Brenner, Leslie Barnett and R.J. Watts-Tobin proved the three-letter code in 1961. Actually, by the use of T4 one of the phages Delbrück introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear if Delbrück or Gamow, who both studied in Göttingen, Germany, spent some postdoctoral time in Niels Bohr’s lab in Copenhagen, and stayed in contact later in the US, were involved in the planning of the Seattle World Fair Science Exhibition. But Delbrück was corresponding with Hans Neurath who joined the University of Washington School of Medicine
faculty in 1950 to head the new biochemistry department and later would become &lt;a href=&quot;https://magazine.washington.edu/hans-neurath-1909-2002/&quot;&gt;a member of the
national science planning board of the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, its section on molecular biology, a science still in its infancy in 1962, would not have been possible without the scientific work Delbrück had done since the early 1930s. In a 1935 publication also known as the “Green Pamphlet” he, N. Timofeeff-Ressovky and K. G. Zimmer presented evidence that genes are material and not just abstract entities (2). Delbrück envisioned the gene as a collection of atoms that should be accessible for concrete experimental analyses. Since 1938 Delbrück worked in the US where he introduced bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, into the scientific field that would become molecular genetics. Together with Salvador Luria, Delbrück demonstrated that mutations in microorganisms do occur randomly at a certain rate and are not a reaction to selection by a changing environment thereby proving that Darwin’s evolution theory also applies to bacteria (3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 1945 he established a yearly phage course at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that would run until 1970. He also gathered the so-called phage group around him which beside many others consisted of later to become Nobel laureates Salvador Luria, Alfred Hershey, James D. Watson, Frank Stahl, and Renato Dulbecco. Hershey together with Martha Chase showed in 1952 that DNA is the carrier of genetic information. Watson together with Francis Crick unraveled the structure of DNA in 1953. Stahl together with Matthew Meselson later showed that both strands of a given DNA molecule serve as templates for newly synthesized strands thus, resulting in two daughter molecules that consist of one of the strands of the original double helix and a newly formed one (semiconservative mode of replication).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted though, that the Century 21 exhibit didn’t just display DNA as the newest scientific sensation but presented molecular biology in a much broader context that started out from Darwin’s Beagle voyage and presented genetics as the brainchild of evolution theory (4) that via phage genetics represented by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/singleitem/image/p15015coll3/322/default.jpg&quot;&gt;huge 3D model of the T2 phage&lt;/a&gt;, one of Delbrück’s T phages, led to the elucidation of the double helix structure of DNA as the molecular basis of inheritance. That the final report (5) summarized the exhibition under the title “Evolution and Heredity – From Darwin to DNA” and the visitors path started with the work of Darwin and ended with the DNA models indicates that Evolution Theory and the Modern Synthesis were central to the exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find contemporary reactions from creationists. However, this may be not surprising because Morris and Whitcomb published The Genesis Flood just the year before and the ICR would only be established a decade later. Thus, creationism in its today’s highly organized form just didn’t exist or any such critique is hidden in archives not accessible today. On the other hand, religion seems to have been a part of the exhibition which offered rooms for prayer and Billy Graham visited the fair. According to James Gilbert who covered the Seattle World’s Fair and especially the astronomy part of the science exhibition in his book “Redeeming Culture: American Religion in an Age of Science” (6) it turned out that “even in an age of science it would be unthinkable to avoid a major gesture towards religion”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some back and forth regarding the involvement of religion. While there were suggestions for a Shrine for All Faiths, efforts for a Hall of Religions and a World of Religion display even attempts to depict Christianity with all its facets failed and a committee of local protestant churches, the Christian Witness, became the major religious presence with their own building on the fair ground. However, their idea to compete in the marketplace of ideas has not been too successful although reportedly at some point there were more religious than science events. According to Gilbert even Christian Witness admitted they’ve failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, how effective was the science exhibition? Gilbert argues that it did not effectively teach the lessons it intended. Gilbert concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“1962 no one could reconcile science and religion to the satisfaction of scientists or religious groups, if neither orientation to the world and its problems could prevail in public discussion, if the federal government, scientists, and the business community believed they needed to bring religion inside this grand American commemoration of scientific achievement, the lesson then and now is that science and religion cannot be reconciled nor can either be conquered or contained. The accommodation at Seattle continued the dialectic, extended a running exchange, and signaled the continuing revision of relationships. Extraordinary changes had occurred in American culture since the Scopes trial of 1925 and the foundation of the Conference on Science, Philosophy, and Religion fifteen years later. But nothing had been settled, and that in itself was the only settlement possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of the correctness of the orientation of the displayed DNA models one should be aware that they presented cutting edge science: Watson and Crick would only be awarded the Nobel Prize at the end of the same year, Jacob and Monod’s published their operon theory just the year before, the genetic code was still not fully deciphered, mRNA was more of a concept than an established fact, DNA sequencing was 15 years ahead and things like PCR or Crispr/Cas gene editing were not even imaginable. In addition, it has to be considered that the form and the shape of DNA haven’t been on public display to often before if at all and that the molecule was far from being the icon everybody nowadays recognizes and its name was likely unfamiliar to the majority of the population. Thus, one may conclude that the exhibit’s aim to explain how science works may have been too ambitious and its content may have been too complex for the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a European born in the early 60s the US always appeared to be on the cutting edge of science although I must admit that I was more impressed by things like the atomic car and rockets rather than genetics and evolution back then. I guess the same is true for the majority of visitors. On the other hand, the escalation of the conflict and the power creationism would gain was neither foreseeable at the time and it is sad to see how many people in the US still deny evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There actually was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/PacSci/photos/a.132354883854/10159386557128855/&quot;&gt;third correctly right-handed DNA model&lt;/a&gt; displayed outside of the exhibition hall which today is still in its original place in one of the pools on the fair ground.&lt;/p&gt;

The ICR left-handed DNA logo made it on the pages of Tom Schneider’s Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame immediately and became the sites first entry in 2022.

&lt;p&gt;When is evolution not evolution?  When it's described by creationist/ID sources and is
obviously change effected by selection.  Case in point: any form of selection resulting
from human activity.  On January 27, 2022 the ever-astonishing Denyse O’Leary (“News” at the anti-evolution
website Uncommon Descent) made &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/are-humans-changing-evolution/#comments&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which she linked to an article
on BBC Future by David Farrier.  He starts out by saying that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Humans have shaped the bodies of other creatures at least since dogs were domesticated around
30,000 years ago. But the combination of industrialised farming, introduced species,
urbanisation, pollution, and climate change are creating unprecedented selective pressures. We
have become the world's greatest evolutionary force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farrier’s post, which you will find
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220125-how-humans-are-changing-evolution&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
gives numerous examples of ways humans are accidentally, or deliberately, influencing
evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement looks straightforward, but News will have none of it.  Her response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a human-dominated world, things happen faster, for better or worse. Should we still call
it “evolution” if we did it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, her answer is no, and the UD commenters all applaud this. But they’re all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; Darwin started out, in the first chapter, by reviewing
variation of animals and plants under domestication, and attributes many of the
changes from their wild ancestors to conscious or unconscious artificial selection.
He regarded these processes as a close parallel to natural selection, a good way
to introduce the concept to readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists have a way of totally dismissing the analogy.  Why, it's intelligent design
by humans, they cry.  How can anyone think that it in any way the same as natural
selection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we can.  When we set out to breed cows for, say, increased butterfat content of
their milk, the one thing that artificial selection does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do is start with a
detailed scheme of the genes that influence butterfat content, and then engineer each
one to increase that trait.  Instead we breed from the cattle that have highest
milk butterfat content, or their immediate relatives. Farmers and herders have been
doing that for thousands of years.  They don’t know what genes are involved, and how
they influence the trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is the same for natural selection.  Certain phenotypes have higher
fitness than others, and that itself leads to the alleles they contain being
better represented in the next generation.  Neither wolves preying on deer, nor farmers
trying to get more butterfat from their cows, carry around with them a detailed
genetic plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin's analogy is a powerful and convincing one.  All that creationists can do
is to flatly declare that the analogy is false.   There's more to say, but I'll
leave that to the comment section, and mostly to our commenters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Tuskless bull Asian Elephant in Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary, Thailand.

Wilson, who died on Dec. 26 and, I think, needs no introduction.  First: an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9848&quot;&gt;obituary&lt;/a&gt; by Stuart Pimm of Duke University and an expert on conservation biology.

Dr. Pimm in particular notes Wilson’s assertion that natural selection might actually select for human behaviors and observed that he was attacked for this view, sometimes unfairly. Both articles were pleasant and made me wish I had met Wilson, rather than just read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Naturalist-Edward-Wilson-ebook/dp/B009LO4796&quot;&gt;memoir&lt;/a&gt; of his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attacks have not stopped, and on December 29, before Wilson’s body was metaphorically cold, &lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt; published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-complicated-legacy-of-e-o-wilson/&quot;&gt;hatchet job&lt;/a&gt; by a nursing professor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.ucsf.edu/monica.mclemore&quot;&gt;Monica McLemore&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California, San Francisco.

O. Wilson, calling him a racist&lt;/a&gt;, by Jerry Coyne, who does not mince his words, even in a title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Google Scholar, Dr. McLemore is an author or coauthor of a fair number of papers in scientific journals (she says, “81 peer reviewed articles, OpEds and commentaries,” as well as being cited here and there, but only journal articles count).

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of this interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ivpress.com/the-genealogical-adam-and-eve&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Joshua_Swamidass&quot;&gt;S. Joshua Swamidass&lt;/a&gt;, posits that the scientific evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that we could all be descended from a single couple who lived in comparatively recent times, say, 10,000 years or so ago. The conventional wisdom is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve&quot;&gt;Mitochondrial Eve&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent matrilineal common ancestor of all people alive today, and Y-Chromosomal Adam, our most recent patrilineal common ancestor, lived at very different times 100,000 or more years ago and so could not have been a couple. Dr. Swamidass, an MD, holds a PhD in information science, and is an associate professor at Washington University in St Louis. He is the real McCoy, not someone who has quit to shill for Answers in Genesis, Reasons to Believe, or Aish HaTorah, and must be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full title of the book is &lt;i&gt;The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science of Universal Ancestry&lt;/i&gt;. In it, the author makes a distinction between your &lt;i&gt;genealogical&lt;/i&gt; ancestry and your &lt;i&gt;genetic&lt;/i&gt; ancestry. He notes that your genes are diluted from one generation to the next, so that eventually people who are in fact your descendants will very probably have none of your genes. I think of it as diluting a solution over and over again: eventually, none of the solute will remain in the solvent, because the solute is not infinitely continuous but rather is made up of atoms or molecules. Once the last solute molecule is gone, the concentration is 0. In the same way, your genes (or your genetic inheritance) are not continuous, and once the last gene is gone, your descendants inherit none of your DNA. (When I read this account, I was reminded of T.H. Huxley’s lament after having read &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley&quot;&gt;How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your descendants, though they are not genetic descendants, are still your descendants; Dr. Swamidass calls them your &lt;i&gt;genealogical descendants&lt;/i&gt;. Unlike your genetic descendants, who dwindle in number, your genealogical descendants are apt to grow in number. Eventually, as they crossbreed with the genealogical descendants of others, one lineage will comprise the entire population of earth (I will not go into detail here, but Dr. Swamidass is at pains to document what you might call sufficient “crosstalk” among nearly all populations on earth, though I think he may have forgotten about New Guinea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, one lucky couple eventually becomes the most recent universal genealogical ancestral couple, and Dr. Swamidass dubs them the MRUGA (a designation which, alas, does not have the same ring as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_common_ancestor&quot;&gt;LUCA&lt;/a&gt;). I did not understand precisely why he chose the date 1 CE, but Dr. Swamidass estimates that the MRUGA may have lived “a few thousand years ago,” and the entire population of the earth became their genealogical descendants in 1 CE. Could they have been Adam and Eve? Did God create them &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;? Sure, I suppose they (or a couple ancestral to them) could have and he could have. I began to think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot&quot;&gt;Russell’s teapot&lt;/a&gt;, but Dr. Swamidass presents us with his own version, a unicorn on the far side of the Moon. Dr. Swamidass is somewhat coy, but he remarks on the absence of evidence for or against his hypotheses so frequently, especially in the first half of the book, that I began to think, with Gertrude, the doctor doth protest too much, methinks. Nevertheless, if his purpose is to debunk the conventional wisdom concerning Y-Chromosomal Adam and Mitochondrial Eve, I think he has succeeded admirably. And perhaps he has taught scientists a lesson: Don’t be too sure of yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Swamidass’s vision seems to be that of a Garden of Eden in which Adam and Eve are created &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; from dust and a rib, and eventually released into the world of (to borrow a phrase from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Science-of-God/Gerald-L-Schroeder/9781439129586&quot;&gt;Gerald Schroeder&lt;/a&gt;, 1997 ed.) pre-Adamic hominids; at least, he argues that scientific evidence cannot rule out this possibility, and indeed he considers others as well. Even if Adam and Eve have been created miraculously, the pre-Adamic hominids evolved according to normal evolution. Dr. Swamidass calls Adam and Eve and their descendants, &lt;i&gt;textual humans&lt;/i&gt;, because they are mentioned in the Bible. These textual humans and their descendants interbreed with the pre-Adamic hominids, whom Dr. Swamidass calls &lt;i&gt;biological humans&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; descendants. Eventually the textual humans and their genealogical descendants predominate. To put it bluntly, I see no reason to think there is a unicorn on the far side of the Moon, and I similarly see no reason to think that Adam and Eve were created &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; in a sequestered garden just a few thousand years ago, while other humans evolved outside the garden in the normal manner. (Did Adam and Eve have the same genome, incidentally, and if so was their relationship incestuous?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schroeder declared that Adam and Eve were the first hominids to be given souls. As evidence, he points to the sudden flowering of civilization and technology at about the right time. Dr. Swamidass likewise seems to think that there was something (theologically) special about Adam and Eve, but I think he does not really specify what that means.  He notes, however, that Adam and Eve and their descendants are otherwise indistinguishable from the hominids living around them and indeed interbreed with them. I am frankly disturbed by this concept, because (protestations to the contrary), it implies that biological humans who did not descend from the Garden of Eden were somehow less than fully textual humans, that is, less than genealogical descendants of the pair in the garden. I do not want to inveigh against a proposition because of its possible consequences, but I know all too well what happens when some people are considered to be intrinsically different (a problem which Dr. Swamidass to his credit also acknowledges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I am not putting words into his mouth, but Dr. Swamidass must think that something, some essence, call it textuality if you like, somehow propagates to the descendants of Adam and Eve, but exactly how does it do so? Is the textuality encoded genetically?  Epigenetically?  Is it dominant or recessive? Do all the descendants become textual humans, or do some remain merely biological humans? Is textuality badly diluted generation after generation, until it disappears? If not, does it follow Adam and Eve’s genealogical descendants, and if so, how? None of these questions is posed, let alone answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Swamidass has avowedly written his book in order to attract creationists to evolutionary biology or at least to make them feel less threatened by evolutionary biology, and also to attract atheists and agnostics to religion. I cannot speak for creationists, but I cannot see atheists taking the book very seriously. The last chapter is in part an appeal to anyone who does not take the origin story literally, and Dr. Swamidass rightly corrects those who think that science has definitively ruled out Adam and Eve. He calls for tolerance and suggests that we avoid abusing scientific authority. All very well, and I cannot agree with him more. But does his discovery that Adam and Eve “could have” been an actual couple that existed in the near past influence my belief or nonbelief in God? Not one whit. And the suggestion that they “may have” been created &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; in a walled garden seems to me like sheer fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am keenly interested in scientific or textual arguments designed to elucidate the origins of the Bible and the existence or nonexistence of the people and events therein. Perhaps that is one reason that I was interested in the concept of a genealogical descendant. The argument that a single couple could have been the ancestors of everyone alive today was interesting and clever, and people will assume that that couple was Adam and Eve. Indeed, the book would not be particularly interesting if we thought the couple might not have been Adam and Eve. Before the couple’s descendants dominated the entire earth, however, each previous generation would have had a different pair of ancestors, as Dr. Swamidass himself makes clear. Why would we not think that one of those many couples may have been Adam and Eve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confession: I could barely get through the theological arguments in the latter part of the book. They read to me like the proverbial &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_many_angels_can_dance_on_the_head_of_a_pin%3F&quot;&gt;angels dancing on the head of a pin&lt;/a&gt;, which I have always understood to be a metaphor for answering the question whether angels have volume or mass or something, while implicitly presuming the somewhat problematic existence of angels. Dr. Swamidass expends considerable energy trying to deduce whether people existed outside the Garden. All you have to do is take one look at the text and conclude that, of course, it implies existence of other people (see, for example, Nephilim or the myth surrounding the mark of Cain and Cain’s wife in Genesis 6:4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Swamidass has an ax to grind – he needs to be acceptable to fundamentalist Christians – so he scrutinizes the text in fine detail in order to establish the existence of people outside the Garden &lt;i&gt;Biblically&lt;/i&gt;. The Appendix, which is a reprint of a paper by the author, seemed unnecessary and unrelated to the rest of the book; it must similarly be intended to appeal to a fundamentalist Christian audience. I cannot agree with his conclusion concerning the historicity of either Jesus of Nazareth or his supposed Resurrection. I do not doubt that someone like the Jesus described in the so-called New Testament may have existed, but in fact, there is no contemporaneous evidence in support of that contention; even the earliest Gospel was written 40 years after Jesus died. Likewise, I maintain that “prophecies” in the Hebrew Bible are mere cherry-picked anachronisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not get me wrong. The book is well thought out and mostly clearly written, though frankly it could have used an editor to shorten it by 30 % or so. It has a great many figures, most of which are clear and add to our understanding (I found, among a few others, Figure 1 and one or two of its variants somewhat difficult, however).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of genealogical ancestry is clever, and the estimates as to when they existed are surprisingly recent. Equally surprising, our most recent genealogical ancestors are a couple; this conclusion is contrary to the conventional wisdom, which focuses on genetic ancestry and places Mitochondrial Eve and Y-Chromosomal Adam many thousands of years in the past. Nevertheless, to my mind there is no evidence to suggest that our genealogical ancestors have any Biblical or theological significance whatsoever. Genealogical ancestry is merely an amusing puzzle, and the discovery that our most recent universal genealogical ancestors have been recent seems to me to have no more significance than the discovery that our last universal common (genetic) ancestor was not recent. It does not make me think, “Oh, maybe there is more to this Adam and Eve myth than I had supposed!”&lt;/p&gt;

Joshua Swamidass, posits that the scientific evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that we could all be descended from a single couple who lived in comparatively recent times, say, 10,000 years or so ago. The conventional wisdom is that Mitochondrial Eve, the most recent matrilineal common ancestor of all people alive today, and Y-Chromosomal Adam, our most recent patrilineal common ancestor, lived at very different times 100,000 or more years ago and so could not have been a couple. Dr. Swamidass, an MD, holds a PhD in information science, and is an associate professor at Washington University in St Louis. He is the real McCoy, not someone who has quit to shill for Answers in Genesis, Reasons to Believe, or Aish HaTorah, and must be taken seriously. The full title of the book is The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science of Universal Ancestry. In it, the author makes a distinction between your genealogical ancestry and your genetic ancestry. He notes that your genes are diluted from one generation to the next, so that eventually people who are in fact your descendants will very probably have none of your genes. I think of it as diluting a solution over and over again: eventually, none of the solute will remain in the solvent, because the solute is not infinitely continuous but rather is made up of atoms or molecules. Once the last solute molecule is gone, the concentration is 0. In the same way, your genes (or your genetic inheritance) are not continuous, and once the last gene is gone, your descendants inherit none of your DNA.
