&lt;figcaption&gt;Enlargement of detail &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/&quot;&gt;from Elisabeth Bik’s blog&lt;/a&gt;, one of several illustrations showing apparently duplicated areas within the key figures of the paper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3&quot;&gt;A Tunguska sized airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam …&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared the excitement when I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that “in ~ 1650 BCE (~ 3600 years ago), a cosmic airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam, a Middle-Bronze-Age city in the southern Jordan Valley northeast of the Dead Sea,” and that this event could have given rise to the biblical account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Somewhat to my surprise, Ken Ham of &lt;i&gt;Answers in Genesis&lt;/i&gt; did not. I now think that Ken’s conclusion [1] was right and I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I suspect many of the journalists and interested readers who swooped on this story, I failed at first to notice that the paper was not, despite the link, an article in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; but in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;. This is one of the stable of second-line journals closely linked to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; being published by Springer, now controlled by the publishing giant Hotlzbrinck, and profiting from &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;’s reputation for excellence. I was only vaguely aware of the authors’ long history of invoking airbursts, took the many kinds of evidence listed at face value, and did not even blink at the claim that “[a]n airburst-related influx of salt (~ 4 wt.%) produced hypersalinity,” a process for which I can envisage no credible mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have since described this work to a much larger audience in &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/a-giant-space-rock-demolished-an-ancient-middle-eastern-city-and-everyone-in-it-possibly-inspiring-the-biblical-story-of-sodom-167678&quot;&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, where they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w&quot;&gt;repeat their claim&lt;/a&gt;, also published in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, of a similar catastrophe at Abu Hureyra in what is now Syria, around 10,800 BCE, assert that “it almost certainly won’t be the last time a human city meets this fate,” claim that such events “pose a severe modern-day hazard,” and advise that “unless orbiting or ground-based telescopes detect these rogue objects, the world may have no warning, just like the people of Tall el-Hammam.” The Abu Hureya paper also repeats &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_hypothesis&quot;&gt;a litany of earlier claims&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas&quot;&gt;Younger Dryas&lt;/a&gt;, a period of severe cold in the northern hemisphere from around 12,900 to 11,700  years Before Present [Present is fixed at 1950 CE], was caused by a  series of impacts with cometary debris, spread over at least four continents. These claims have been severely disputed; see papers listed below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prominent among the critics is my friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Boslough&quot;&gt;Mark Boslough&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on such cataclysmic events who even has an asteroid named after him. He tells me that he is tired of repeated rebuttal of what he considers to be obviously false claims, and of seeing his own theoretical analysis of the effect of airbursts invoked as an explanation of claims completely inconsistent with such a process, or perhaps any credible process. For this reason, rather than publishing yet another counterblast that will be ignored, he has taken to describing the controversy, extending over many years, on Twitter (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/1440097126856282113&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/1440378973309968391&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequent threads).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous reasons for concern about the Tall el-Hammam paper in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper tells us, “The project is under the aegis of the School of Archaeology, Veritas International University, Santa Ana, CA, and the College of Archaeology, Trinity Southwest University, Albuquerque, NM, under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://viu.ves.edu/doctrinal-statement/&quot;&gt;Veritas International University believes in&lt;/a&gt; “the full historicity and comprehensibility of the biblical record.” It is accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), which I have written about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2013/11/credit-where-none-is-due-creationist-colleges-and-courses-i-am-browsing-school-science-textbooks-pub.html&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. Trinity Southwest University, which now operates from an office in a strip mall in Albuquerque, was formerly in Tulsa, Oklahoma, under the name Southwest Biblical Seminary, and rejects any government accreditation whatsoever as intrusive violation of the separation of Church and State. While the traditional site of Sodom is in Israel (and within the pre-1967 boundaries), Tall el-Hammam is in Jordan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corresponding author is Allen West, who has been publishing prolifically in this area since 2005 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6434d1px&quot;&gt;Evidence for the Extinction of Mammoths by an Extraterrestrial Impact Event&lt;/a&gt;) and in 2006 co-authored a book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=d1ooDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PT14&amp;amp;dq=%22Allen+West%22&amp;amp;ots=9QLiSjyrE3&amp;amp;sig=6pEWeeRLpuPRJeGozdWInxrMUsw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Allen%20West%22&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes: How a Stone-Age Comet Changed the Course of World Culture&lt;/a&gt;, which claims  that the debris of a shattered comet was responsible for  “a cosmic chain of events [that] began 41,000 years ago and culminated in a major global  catastrophe  28,000 years later.” These events include everything from the extinction of the mammoths to the landform of the Carolina Bays to the legend of Atlantis to a purported “mysterious layer of black sediment” found spanning North America to the Younger Dryas discussed in the Abu Hureya paper.  West has no academic qualifications or affiliations and gives his address as Comet Research Group (CRG), Prescott, Arizona (several of the other authors are also members of this group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/&quot;&gt;which is linked&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authortalk.audio/&quot;&gt;Rising Light Group&lt;/a&gt;, a 501(c)3, tax-exempt charitable organization with a clear Christian and biblical agenda, registered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.authortalk.audio/501-c3.html&quot;&gt;Allen West’s name&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/environment/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180&quot;&gt;detailed by Pacific Standard Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, discussing how thing stood regarding CRG’s work in 2017, there have been calls for a formal inquiry, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; University of Wyoming archaeologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/SUROVELL/&quot;&gt;Todd Surovell&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues couldn’t find increased magnetic spherules representing cosmic debris at seven &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/106/43/18155.abstract?sid=49d79c32-625b-4cdd-bbb2-3ff3254f8a46&quot;&gt;Clovis sites&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geology.siu.edu/people/pinter/index.html&quot;&gt;Nicholas Pinter&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues at Southern Illinois University Carbondale argue the carbon spherules are organic residue of fungus or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2010GL043345.shtml&quot;&gt;arthropod excrement&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&quot;http://physics.wustl.edu/people/daulton_tyrone-l&quot;&gt;Tyrone Daulton&lt;/a&gt; of Washington University in St. Louis and his colleagues reported that supposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16043&quot;&gt;nanodiamonds formed by the impact were misidentified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous other concerns specific to the present work &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143&quot;&gt;have been presented&lt;/a&gt; at PubPeer, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/&quot;&gt;very detailed concerns&lt;/a&gt; have been raised by Elisabeth Bik in her blog, Science Integrity Digest, where she presents evidence that images in the paper had been manipulated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in an acrimonious exchange with me in the Comments section of &lt;i&gt;The Conversation&lt;/i&gt;, Wells pointed out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our group included, among many others: Dr. James Kennett, emeritus professor at UCSB, specializing in stratigraphy, micropaleontology, paleobiology. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, which recognizes the contributions of just 0.1% of all scientists. Dr. Ted Bunch, former NASA section chief and a world-leading meteoriticist. Dr. Robert Hermes, retired from Los Alamos National Labs, world-recognized expert in trinitite or atomic glass. Dr. Wendy Wolbach, chemistry professor who discovered high-temperature soot at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied with a listing of some papers that I have examined criticising West’s own earlier work regarding airbursts, including sampling techniques and claimed evidence for very high temperatures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We await his decision with interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Though not his reasoning, Ken’s argument is based on his Ussher-style &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/how-does-mans-history-fit-with-the-biblical-timeline/&quot;&gt;biblical timeline&lt;/a&gt;, which places the call of Abraham at 1922 BCE, whereas the destruction of Tall el-Hammam is dated to ~ 1650 BCE. For what it’s worth (not much, I know), this disagreement would disappear if we use, instead, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BCE for the Creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not read Stephen Meyer’s new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G122JJN/&quot;&gt;Return of the God Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;, subtitled “Three Scientific Discoveries That Reveal the Mind Behind the Universe,” and possibly will not. I had not been aware that the God hypothesis had ever gone away, and 700-odd pages of what looks like old hat seems perhaps a bit excessive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, what may look to some like an unlikely source, the right-wing blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(website)&quot;&gt;Ricochet&lt;/a&gt;, may have saved me the trouble: They recently ran a splendid “&lt;a href=&quot;https://ricochet.com/1059644/stephen-meyers-return-of-the-god-hypothesis/&quot;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt;” of the book by &lt;a href=&quot;https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1535406429/clearer-thinking-with-spencer-greenberg/liberalism-and-conservatism-with-cassandra-xia-and-hank-racette&quot;&gt;Henry Racette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mr. Racette, the book stands on three pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The universe had a beginning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The universe is fine-tuned for life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The genetic code is evidence of an intelligent designer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Racette considers the fine-tuning argument to be the strongest of the three. Nevertheless, he ultimately dismisses it and wisely invokes the God of the Gaps before concluding,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Meyer has written a book that could have been written at any time during our long quest for understanding. The details would change, the sophistication would vary, but the product would be similar: a man standing on the edge of the unknown surveys the wisest men around him and concludes that, since they have no wholly satisfactory answers, one or another god is the most plausible explanation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I shall have no need to read this book, since Mr. Racette has done so for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Guest post by &lt;strong&gt;Dan Phelps&lt;/strong&gt;, to whom we are indebted for unearthing this whopper from Answers in Genesis:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, creationists are misrepresenting a recent dinosaur discovery.

&lt;p&gt;The Board of Trustees of Huxley College met the day before yesterday, September 17, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trustees.wwu.edu/files/00%20BOT%20Sept%202021%20Work%20Session%20Agenda%20-%20FINAL.pdf&quot;&gt;solely to discuss renaming the college &lt;/a&gt;. According to a source whom I prefer to leave anonymous,*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he consensus seems to be to drop the Huxley name. They acknowledge that there was lots of information submitted both in support of and opposed to dropping the Huxley name. They acknowledge that Huxley did lots of great stuff both as a scientist and as a strong abolitionist and a defender of universal human rights, and in expanding educational opportunities for a diverse audience. However, they were troubled by some of the bigoted and sexist language that Huxley made at times. They also point out that Huxley had no real links to the Pacific Northwest or North America. Fair point. It sounds like they just don’t have the stomach to deal with the blowback of rejecting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-07/LRTF%20Report%20and%20Recommendations_June%202021.pdf&quot;&gt;Legacy Review Task Force&lt;/a&gt;. No decision but it seems clear where they want to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

They then went on the discuss &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-02/WWU%20Building%20Names%20Report%20Sept%202020.pdf&quot;&gt;Mathes and Haggard&lt;/a&gt; [two dormitories]. They are not inclined to reject these two, in spite of the majority recommendation of the Task Force to do so, and made comments along the line that “you should judge people based on the standards and language used in their time, not by modern standards.” Interesting that they are not inclined to use the same standard for Huxley. They want to judge him based on modern standards.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is curious that they only now discovered that Huxley had no direct connection to their area. If I wanted to be suspicious, I might suspect that they plan to change the name of the college on a pretext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another source thought it was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[a] very sad and embarrassing spectacle all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It started well enough, with written comments from the student board member who couldn’t be there. His comments were read/summarized by the chair. He expressed concern with the Task Force report and the impact it would have on the academic reputation of the university. He also seemed concerned with a “purity” test that was being applied to Huxley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

From there I couldn’t tell which Board member was speaking, so I’ll just refer to them generically in the order in which they spoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The first Board member obviously felt uncomfortable with the racism claims in the Task Force report and sought to distance the Board from them by suggesting a wholly different reason for changing the name: that Huxley had no real historic connection to WWU. On that principle alone she said she was prepared to dename the college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

President Randhawa supported this, saying the key principle should be a direct connection to the university. Huxley's contributions pro and con are moot if relationship to the university is the main criterion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It was all downhill from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The next board member said that denaming would have a de minimis impact on T.H. Huxley’s reputation because WWU is a regional university, so it wasn’t as if an organization with a national or international reputation made such a name change. He said there was a high cost in defending the name with little return. He accused Huxley of being an early eugenicist, and claimed that he had no connection to public education institutions like Huxley College. He called Huxley’s reputation “controversial.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The next board member recognized that she was talking from an emotional perspective. She repeated the creationist trope that Huxley advocated a hierarchical theory of race and, because of that, going to a school named after him reminded her of the harm caused by going to a high school in Baltimore named after Roger B. Taney, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who wrote the Dred Scott decision. So in short, she compared Huxley’s legacy to Taney's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Sensing the overwhelming sentiment, the Board chair than suggested that they needed to start thinking through how they were going to communicate the thought process behind their decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Another Board member asked if they need more input, more process. The chair restated this, asking if they needed to rehear the case? The response overall from several board members was no, there was plenty of opportunity for input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

One Board member suggested voting at the October meeting. The president suggested it would be better to do so at the December meeting, or it will look like it was all worked out in advance. Several others concurred and suggested that the October meeting focus on communicating the rationale for the denaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

So in summary, they totally bought the creationist narrative in the Task Force report. I was embarrassed for them, for WWU, and for my own association with WWU.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another source observed that, when a committee was appointed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;usually the decision on the path forward had already been made.  We were part of the required process.  But I do think all that work did make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Universities in Washington are essentially non-regulatory State Agencies and therefore policy making political bodies.  The process here is clearly political, and the members of the Board are political appointees.  It does now appear that at least some of the members of the Board are realizing the significance of the misinformation presented by the Huxley section of the report.  Without our efforts [I think he refers to comments submitted to the task force and the article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/reconsider-cancel-culture-target-at-wwu/&quot;&gt;Reconsider cancel-culture target at WWU&lt;/a&gt; in the Seattle Times, and maybe even the earlier articles in PT] the motion to change the name would have been presented and passed at yesterday’s and certainly by October’s Board meeting.  [At least we have gotten their attention, and] the Board and the President are now looking for ways to remove the name of Huxley from the college without claiming social injustice or racism.  The Seattle Times piece stated that there may be other reasons for removing Huxley as the name of the college, but that the racist and injustice charges were not true. Perhaps that is where they are thinking of going now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps amusingly, the Task Force also discussed changing the name of the Viking Union, which I assume is the student union. The Viking is also the mascot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Washington_Vikings&quot;&gt;University’s sports teams&lt;/a&gt;. Footnote 49 in their report tells you more than you want to know about the choice of the Viking mascot. If nothing else, the Task Force seems concerned that “Vikings have been romanticized by white supremacist groups as icons of conquest,” and white supremacists have been active on campus. One final source said that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;they seemed pretty resigned to the idea that that name would eventually change also.  There was some comment along the lines that any group of people has probably done something awful to someone else at some point, probably true.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* I have cited several sources and I have tacit permission to quote them, but I have left them anonymous to protect them from any possible retaliation. I have lightly edited their comments, for example, by replacing initialisms with full spellings when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Western Washington University mascot.

the first correct probabilistic analysis of “DNA evolutionary adaptation” and “competition”, and that call for
evolutionary biologists to provide an analysis of the Lenski and Kishony experiments in bacterial evolution.  He
also argues that we have not provided a correct analysis of bacterial antibiotic resistence or of the evolution
of drug resistance in cancer.  This thread is intended to allow discussion of these assertions, without disrupting discussions of other topics at PT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kleinman has published 7 papers on modeling evolutionary processes.  I have provided links to PDFs of these, when I encountered ones that might be free:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has also brought his argument up repeatedly at Peaceful Science and at 
Panda&quot;s Thumb,
usually in the middle of threads devoted to other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic calculation he does is to consider a haploid clonally-reproducing organism such
a bacterial culture, one which has no recombination.  He develops a formula for the
probability that the clone has beneficial mutations occuring at &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; sites, where the
first such mutation has &lt;em&gt;nGA&lt;/em&gt; generations to occur, the second has &lt;em&gt;nGB&lt;/em&gt; generations to
occur, and so on.  Note that an important feature of his model is that he considers,
not the time in generations but the number of cells that have ever arisen in the clone.
So with a probability &lt;em&gt;mu PA&lt;/em&gt; for each new cell that
it has a beneficial mutation, it takes about &lt;em&gt;1/(mu PA)&lt;/em&gt; cells before there is a
reasonable probability of seeing the beneficial mutation once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mystery (to me, anyway) is where selection is in all this.  We are computing
probabilities that, when a given number of cells has arisen, we have had
beneficial mutation at all of the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; sites.  Once one has occurred, there seems to
be no futher mutation at that site.  Why?   This calculation is supposed to show
us the fundamental mathematical theory of mutation &lt;em&gt;and selection&lt;/em&gt;, but aside from
waiting until a mutation labelled “beneficial” occurs, there is no further
effect of selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same theory is also used in most of his other papers (an exception being the paper
on recombination which I will get back to later).  He has an idiosyncratic terminology.
As far as I can tell it involves calling the occurrence of beneficial mutations by
mutation “DNA adaptive evolution” while he calls their subsequent changes of gene
frequency in the population “competition”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions arise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kleinman sees two processes at work: “competition” which is survival of the fittest, and “DNA evolutionary adaptation” which is
changes of genotypes by mutation, either deleterious or beneficial.  Is this terminology helpful?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;His equations are all about how many organisms (or cells) need to have arisen to get a given probability that a beneficial
allele will arise by mutation.  The theory uses the stochastic process of mutation. How does natural selection affect
this?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;His treatment of recombination between genotypes with two or more loci assumes that offspring of a cross between a haploid
Ab genotype and a haploid  aB  genotype will all be  AB.  Is that true?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He seems to think that he is the first to give a correct mathematical theory of
mutation and natural selection.  Was he?  For example, his first paper has the
rather astonishingly grand title “The basic science and mathematics of random mutation and
natural selection”. Would RA Fisher
(1922) or JBS Haldane (1924) have agreed?  I think he is off by 97-99 years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is he really the first to apply the mathematics of population genetics theory to evolution or drug resistance in cancer, or to
success of multidrug therapies for diseases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I must be misunderstanding how his theory works, and I hope that this thread will explain his theory to me.
After all, if it is the fundamental mathematical theory of my own field, then it is surely important to know.
By doing the discussion here, we can avoid being so rudely interrupted by the folks in the previous threads who were trying to discuss arguments
other than Kleinman&quot;s.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Alan Kleinman has been commenting on various threads here at PT, in ways that repeatedly argue that he has done the first correct probabilistic analysis of “DNA evolutionary adaptation” and “competition”, and that call for evolutionary biologists to provide an analysis of the Lenski and Kishony experiments in bacterial evolution.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistling_duck&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dendrocygna viduata&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – white-faced whistling ducks, Botswana. The photographer writes, &quot;Here is a trio of white-faced whistling ducks. It’s not a particularly scientifically informative shot, but it’s one of my all-time favorite photos. Whistling ducks, on the other hand, are interesting from a number of perspectives. They’re the sister group of all other Anatidae, and they’re a very old genus: genetic divergence within &lt;i&gt;Dendrocygna&lt;/i&gt; is approximately equal to that within the rest of Anatidae. And yet they all look pretty much alike, so we have a fine example of morphological stasis. That may also be the reason that white-faced whistling ducks, with fairly sedentary habits, are nevertheless found in both Africa and South America with no recognized subspecific variation. (Fulvous whistling ducks &lt;i&gt;D. bicolor&lt;/i&gt; are worse: they’re found in North and South America, Africa, and India, still with no subspecies.)&quot;

Dendrocygna viduata – white-faced whistling ducks, Botswana. The photographer writes, &quot;Here is a trio of white-faced whistling ducks. It’s not a particularly scientifically informative shot, but it’s one of my all-time favorite photos. Whistling ducks, on the other hand, are interesting from a number of perspectives. They’re the sister group of all other Anatidae, and they’re a very old genus: genetic divergence within Dendrocygna is approximately equal to that within the rest of Anatidae. And yet they all look pretty much alike, so we have a fine example of morphological stasis.

The photographer writes, &quot;Some references list this as a subspecies of &lt;i&gt;Euphydryas chalcedona&lt;/i&gt; (chalcedon or variable checkerspot).  I am not a butterfly expert and this is my best attempt at identification.&quot;
