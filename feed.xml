&lt;p&gt;I was dismayed last Thursday to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/science/conservatives-have-difficult-relationship-science/&quot;&gt;the following paragraph&lt;/a&gt; posted by AiG under Ken Ham’s byline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/many-conservatives-have-a-difficult-relationship-with-science-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-165499&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; [in &lt;i&gt;The Conversation&lt;/i&gt;], the author uses the term &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; to refer to the so-called “scientific consensus” regarding things such as climate change alarmism, vaccinations, evolution, and a lack of “human exceptionalism.” But what the author is failing to recognize is the difference between observational and historical science. In other words, this author has a “difficult relationship with science” because the author doesn’t understand the word &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time, Answers in Genesis has &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/environmental-science/ice-cores-secret-understanding-earths-climate/&quot;&gt;minimized the importance of human-made climate change&lt;/a&gt;, as have &lt;a href=&quot;https://creation.com/climate-change&quot;&gt;Creation Ministries International&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2020/04/tyson-and-cosmos-sound-the-climate-alarm-again/&quot;&gt;Discovery Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and this position of necessity involves denying the authority of a declared scientific consensus. However, Answers in Genesis has hitherto accepted the value of vaccines, and in two recent related articles, &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/human-body/wise-blood-overcoming-in-disease-immunity-part-1/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/human-body/wise-blood-antibodies-principle-overcoming-disease-part-2/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, gives a detailed scientific account of how vaccines work, and praises their effectiveness in the context of the complexity of the immune system, which of course for AiG is evidence for creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/many-conservatives-have-a-difficult-relationship-with-science-we-wanted-to-find-out-why-165499&quot;&gt;article in &lt;i&gt;The Conversation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cited above, reports that “[p]eople with a libertarian or conservative worldview are more likely to reject climate change and evolution and &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250123&quot;&gt;are less likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;,” and in the US context relates such rejection of science and an exaggerated view of human exceptionalism, to religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical versus observation nonsense is familiar, as are the attacks on scientific consensus and on concern about climate change, and our models of climate change do indeed involve the “historical science” that uses ice cores and other techniques to map climate change throughout the Ice Ages and beyond. But including “vaccinations” in the areas of scientific consensus apparently to be rejected is alarming. The study of vaccine effectiveness is very much part of current observational science, and we can see no good reason for Answers in Genesis to be turning against it, even on their own terms.
What we must fear is that AiG may be about to fall in line with other creationist institutions ranging from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B200723&quot;&gt;Grace Community Church&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2020/08/in-fauci-we-trust-c-s-lewis-foresaw-scientific-authoritarianism/&quot;&gt;Discovery Institute&lt;/a&gt; in minimizing the severity of an epidemic that is known to have killed 644,840 people in the US and 4,442,332 worldwide (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/&quot;&gt;as of August 22&lt;/a&gt;). AiG was from the outset &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/coronavirus/coronavirus-biblical-practical/&quot;&gt;ambivalent about masks&lt;/a&gt;, and even jokingly (or blasphemously) telling its readers &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2020/11/28/therefore-tell-you-do-not-be-anxious-about-covid/&quot;&gt;not to be anxious about COVID&lt;/a&gt; just as Jesus told his disciples (Matthew 6:25-34) not to worry about the necessities of life. Despite a rash of articles in March and April of last year, arguing that the mutations giving rise to COVID were not really examples of evolution, AiG has published nothing of significance on the subject since that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not bode well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary theories of evolution involve mutation as the ultimate source of
variability, and model it as having a distribution of directions which is independent
of the needs of the organism. It is natural selection that provides the
directionality of evolutionary change.  There can hardly be any assertion in
the theory that is more disliked by creationists and ID advocates.  Now they
have found a way to oppose this view: argue that randomness cannot be part
of the explanation of any phenomenon that we claim to have explained
scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, there is an unfortunate side effect of this position: many scientific
theories have to be tossed out if we accept it.  Let me explain …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general principle was stated by Eric Holloway, in a post &lt;a href=&quot;https://mindmatters.ai/2021/08/randomness-is-not-a-scientific-explanation/&quot;&gt;“Randomness is
not a Scientific Explanation”&lt;/a&gt; on the Discovery
Institute’s site “Mind Matters” on 9 August 2021.  Mind Matters, a blog
of the DI’s Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence,
is devoted
to making profound arguments as to why artificial intelligence will forever
remain unintelligent, because only supernatural forces can create an
intelligent system.  The article was of course immediately &lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-mind-matters-news-randomness-is-not-a-scientific-explanation/&quot;&gt;greeted with enthusiasm&lt;/a&gt;
at Uncommon Descent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mindmatters.ai/2021/08/randomness-is-not-a-scientific-explanation/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is Holloway’s argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is common in the sciences to claim aspects of our universe are random:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In evolution, mutations are random.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In quantum physics, the wave collapse is random.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In biology, much of the genome is random.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In business theory, organizational ecologists state new ideas are random.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is a general idea that everything new has its origins in randomness.
This is because within our current philosophy of science, the two fundamental
causes in our universe boil down to randomness and necessity. Since necessity
never creates anything new, then by process of elimination the source of
newness must be randomness. Similar to how the ancient Greeks believed the
universe originated from chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s  the irony of the view that whatever is unique in our universe is
random: We can never know if anything is truly random. This is because
randomness is unprovable, which was proven by three different computer
scientists: Ray Solomonoff, Andrey Kolmogorov, and Gregory Chaitin.
The only thing we can know is that something is not random. Hence, we can
never know that something originated from randomness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What does this result mean for science? It means that randomness can never be
a scientific explanation, since we can never know that something is random. At
best, saying something is random is shorthand for “we don’t know”.
So, when scientists state the origin of something in our universe is random,
they do not know the origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that takes care of it, doesn’t it?  Instead of modeling the mutational
process as random, in order to be part of a scientific theory, we must
describe the actual causes of mutation so as to be able to predict individual
mutations.  Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not so fast.  Are there other models used in science that involve
random events?  Yes, definitely.  Here are a few I can think of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Random times of decay of radioactive atoms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Random movements of molecules when they diffuse in solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brownian motion of particles in gases or liquids.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The movement of molecules in a gas, and the distribution of velocities
that results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Random segregation of chromosomes in meiosis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Random changes of gene frequency in a population (random genetic drift).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rolls of dice, spins of roulette wheels, or fall of cards in gambling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are just the ones I can think of, I’m sure there are many more.  If
Holloway’s argument is accepted, all of these successful scientific theories
will need to be discarded  Maybe even probability theory.  The Discovery Institute has just carried out
the greatest revolution in scientific explanation ever. Or tried to, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that none of these theories actually asserts that the universe is
fundamentally stochastic, or fundamentally deterministic.  It just has
phenomena in it that are well-modeled by models involving randomness, which
is a much more limited assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to argue that the argument applies to its original intended
target but not to any of the phenomena on the above list, I would be
interested to hear that.  Though I may be profoundly skeptical of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, does Holloway’s argument work?  Has science been revolutionized?  Any
discussion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish to thank the Discovery Institute for making a science blogger’s life easy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Diffusion, modeled by random movement of molecules.

&lt;p&gt;The plan to rename Huxley College of the Environment at Western Washington University may be gathering steam. As we noted in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/05/canceling-huxley&quot;&gt;earlier article&lt;/a&gt;, this plan seems to be an exercise in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;presentism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by which we mean applying the moral and ethical standards of today to historical figures as if they were aware of them. Less delicately, you might say that presentism is using (or misusing) the moral and ethical standards of today to condemn historical figures and dismiss their achievements. (Indeed, according to the Report cited below, “Some Task Force members questioned how ethical and consensual Huxley’s ethnological methodologies were and evaluated them as failing to meet the University’s contemporary standards for academic integrity [p. 5].” This is presentism at its worst.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier PT article cited above gives the background to the current controversy. Since that article was published, however, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-07/LRTF%20Report%20and%20Recommendations_June%202021.pdf&quot;&gt;Legacy Review Task Force sent its report&lt;/a&gt; to the president, Sabah Randhawa. The “Recommendation Regarding Huxley College of the Environment” is Section 2.1 of the report and occupies pp. 5-13. The president’s cover letter, which we obtained from a faculty member, is noncommittal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Summary section of the report says of Huxley,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, the Task Force unanimously recommends that the Board of Trustees remove T.H. Huxley’s name from the College the Environment. T.H. Huxley accomplished a great deal as a scholar during his lifetime. Unfortunately, his ethnological accomplishments were grounded in white supremacist values that dehumanize and harm many members of the Western community. The Task Force concluded that his legacy conflicts with the university’s current mission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The President of WWU has made statements by historians of science and others concerning Huxley’s work and views available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/research-and-resources&quot;&gt;a resources webpage&lt;/a&gt;.  We call attention to the contrast between the views of Nicolaas Rupke and
Paul White; and also to the article in WWU’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://asreview.org/2021/01/22/thomas-huxley-once-respected-now-rejected/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AS Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which objected to using Huxley’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of faculty at Huxley, with help from several of us on the outside, are organizing to oppose the name change. One such faculty member has asked us, in effect, to crowd-source their response. We also are open to hearing that we should not oppose the name change, particularly if you can say why.  Thus, the following questions, which you may respond to in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the report propagate untruths about Huxley?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most English intellectual figures of Huxley's time probably favored what today we would call racism, imperialism, sexism, and oppression of working people. Although slavery was abolished in England in 1833, the British elite nevertheless supported the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Did Huxley, who was an abolitionist and an important and fervent advocate of making education available to all, favor or oppose these evils? Was he unusual in that regard? Was he involved in efforts to oppose them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the Huxley section of the report accept creationist myths about the relationship between evolutionary biology and racism? Specifically, what are those myths? How do they relate to Huxley?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can anyone point out additional materials or resources that should be taken into account?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any major intellectual figure from the 1800's or even the 1900's whose activities or views are so 
pure that it is acceptable to name something after them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas a name is only symbolic, we consider the matter to be of some importance, if only because we do not want to give in to demands based on unfounded allegations, or allegations that dismiss all the positive achievements associated with an important individual. If an influential scholar such as Huxley can be condemned, who is next? Are we going to develop a “fatal flaw” theory of history, where having one transgression makes it wrong to note their other major accomplishments? Washington enslaved people; should Western Washington University have “Washington” in its name?  If we are impressed by someone’s scientific work, by saying that do we automatically attempt to cover up unpleasant facts about their other views? Let us hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein and Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Thomas Henry Huxley. Reproduction of drawing by T. B. Wirgman, 1882.

Since that article was published, however, the Legacy Review Task Force sent its report to the president, Sabah Randhawa. The “Recommendation Regarding Huxley College of the Environment” is Section 2.1 of the report and occupies pp. 5-13. The president’s cover letter, which we obtained from a faculty member, is noncommittal. The Summary section of the report says of Huxley,</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Psittacula krameri</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/08/Psittacula-krameri.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Psittacula krameri" /><published>2021-08-09T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-08-09T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/08/Psittacula-krameri</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/08/Psittacula-krameri.html">&lt;p&gt;Ring necked parakeet, by &lt;strong&gt;Philip Abrams&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The macro aquarium allowed both good lighting and a decent angle to fit within the short depth of field, and I cannot recommend one enough. The $5 'breeder' aquarium had one plastic side removed and replaced with a pane of glass from a photo frame for better clarity, allowing for desktop aquatic photos.&quot;

the anniversary of the scientist who was, as far as I can see, the first
evolutionary biologist.  No, not Charles Darwin, but Jean-Baptiste Pierre 
Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de Lamarck.  Born in 1744 to an impoverished
branch of the French nobility, he wrote books on botany, coming to the
attention of the Comte de Buffon, who employed him in the royal botanical
garden in Paris.  After Buffon’s death and the French Revolution, he was
appointed to the least important curatorship in the new Museum of Natural
History, as curator of “worms”, i.e., invertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although originally a botanist, he became fascinated by the structure of
invertebrates,
and from 1801 on he argued that they had evolved in a treelike genealogy. His
theory was propounded in his 1809 book “Philosophie zoologique”.  Although
it never convinced most zoologists, it
influenced many thinkers in the early 1800s, including Charles Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamarck was not a crackpot but an important pioneer of invertebrate
biology (he coined the words “invertebrate” and “biology”). He also
put forward the first proposal for a mechanism explaining adaptation. No,
not natural selection, but use and disuse.  This is widely misunderstood,
In what follows I want to briefly explain how it is that people who
think of themselves as Lamarckians get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamarck had two processes.  One was a rather mysterious inherent
complexifying force, which he thought was a basic physical principle
of some sort.  It does not really explain why a species getting more complex
would also be adaptive.  And of course even by as soon as 100 years later, when
physics and chemistry were much better understood, no one thought that
there was any such principle.  So the Lamarckians of the late 1800s
quietly forgot about that part of Lamarck’s theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other process was use and disuse. Organisms used their various
organs, such as eyes, limbs, leaves, etc. to try to cope with their
environments, and these strivings were inherited by their offspring
in ways that resulted in those organs growing a bit in ways that increased
adaptation.  As I explain here every year, everyone in Lamarck’s day
thought that there were such inherited effects.  Lamarck did not
invent inheritance of acquired characters, because it was already
widely accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is where modern Lamarckians go badly wrong.  They think that
it is enough to show that an environmental effect is inherited, such
as by epigenetic mechanisms.  And they think that this vindicates
Lamarck.  But to Lamarck it was the organism’s strivings to cope with
its surroundings that brought about the inherited effect.  That was what
brought about the directionality of the change, in the direction of
adaptation.  A fish tried to swim, and as it used its fins they grew
larger and stronger in its descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just showing an environmental effect would not give this directionality.
If your grandfather experienced a famine, and epigenetic inheritance
resulted in some effect on you, why should we think that these would
make you more resistant to famine?  Rather than, say, increasing your
susceptibility to cancer or heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Lamarckians have not only thrown out Lamarck’s inherent complexifying
force, they misunderstand him as merely invoking inheritance of environmental
effects.  By doing that they also abandon any attempt to explain
why change is biased toward adaptation.  Lamarck would not recognize
their theory.  His was wrong, but it at least addressed the big issue,
Modern Lamarckians don’t even try to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">It has been customary for me to write a post every 1st of August celebrating the anniversary of the scientist who was, as far as I can see, the first evolutionary biologist.
