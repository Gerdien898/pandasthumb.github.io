&lt;p&gt;The plan to rename Huxley College of the Environment at Western Washington University may be gathering steam. As we noted in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/05/canceling-huxley&quot;&gt;earlier article&lt;/a&gt;, this plan seems to be an exercise in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;presentism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by which we mean applying the moral and ethical standards of today to historical figures as if they were aware of them. Less delicately, you might say that presentism is using (or misusing) the moral and ethical standards of today to condemn historical figures and dismiss their achievements. (Indeed, according to the Report cited below, “Some Task Force members questioned how ethical and consensual Huxley’s ethnological methodologies were and evaluated them as failing to meet the University’s contemporary standards for academic integrity [p. 5].” This is presentism at its worst.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier PT article cited above gives the background to the current controversy. Since that article was published, however, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-07/LRTF%20Report%20and%20Recommendations_June%202021.pdf&quot;&gt;Legacy Review Task Force sent its report&lt;/a&gt; to the president, Sabah Randhawa. The “Recommendation Regarding Huxley College of the Environment” is Section 2.1 of the report and occupies pp. 5-13. The president’s cover letter, which we obtained from a faculty member, is noncommittal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Summary section of the report says of Huxley,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, the Task Force unanimously recommends that the Board of Trustees remove T.H. Huxley’s name from the College the Environment. T.H. Huxley accomplished a great deal as a scholar during his lifetime. Unfortunately, his ethnological accomplishments were grounded in white supremacist values that dehumanize and harm many members of the Western community. The Task Force concluded that his legacy conflicts with the university’s current mission.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The President of WWU has made statements by historians of science and others concerning Huxley’s work and views available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://president.wwu.edu/research-and-resources&quot;&gt;a resources webpage&lt;/a&gt;.  We call attention to the contrast between the views of Nicolaas Rupke and
Paul White; and also to the article in WWU’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://asreview.org/2021/01/22/thomas-huxley-once-respected-now-rejected/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;AS Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which objected to using Huxley’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of faculty at Huxley, with help from several of us on the outside, are organizing to oppose the name change. One such faculty member has asked us, in effect, to crowd-source their response. We also are open to hearing that we should not oppose the name change, particularly if you can say why.  Thus, the following questions, which you may respond to in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the report propagate untruths about Huxley?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most English intellectual figures of Huxley's time probably favored what today we would call racism, imperialism, sexism, and oppression of working people. Although slavery was abolished in England in 1833, the British elite nevertheless supported the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Did Huxley, who was an abolitionist and an important and fervent advocate of making education available to all, favor or oppose these evils? Was he unusual in that regard? Was he involved in efforts to oppose them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the Huxley section of the report accept creationist myths about the relationship between evolutionary biology and racism? Specifically, what are those myths? How do they relate to Huxley?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can anyone point out additional materials or resources that should be taken into account?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any major intellectual figure from the 1800's or even the 1900's whose activities or views are so 
pure that it is acceptable to name something after them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas a name is only symbolic, we consider the matter to be of some importance, if only because we do not want to give in to demands based on unfounded allegations, or allegations that dismiss all the positive achievements associated with an important individual. If an influential scholar such as Huxley can be condemned, who is next? Are we going to develop a “fatal flaw” theory of history, where having one transgression makes it wrong to note their other major accomplishments? Washington enslaved people; should Western Washington University have “Washington” in its name?  If we are impressed by someone’s scientific work, by saying that do we automatically attempt to cover up unpleasant facts about their other views? Let us hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein and Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Thomas Henry Huxley. Reproduction of drawing by T. B. Wirgman, 1882.

the anniversary of the scientist who was, as far as I can see, the first
evolutionary biologist.  No, not Charles Darwin, but Jean-Baptiste Pierre 
Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de Lamarck.  Born in 1744 to an impoverished
branch of the French nobility, he wrote books on botany, coming to the
attention of the Comte de Buffon, who employed him in the royal botanical
garden in Paris.  After Buffon’s death and the French Revolution, he was
appointed to the least important curatorship in the new Museum of Natural
History, as curator of “worms”, i.e., invertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although originally a botanist, he became fascinated by the structure of
invertebrates,
and from 1801 on he argued that they had evolved in a treelike genealogy. His
theory was propounded in his 1809 book “Philosophie zoologique”.  Although
it never convinced most zoologists, it
influenced many thinkers in the early 1800s, including Charles Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamarck was not a crackpot but an important pioneer of invertebrate
biology (he coined the words “invertebrate” and “biology”). He also
put forward the first proposal for a mechanism explaining adaptation. No,
not natural selection, but use and disuse.  This is widely misunderstood,
In what follows I want to briefly explain how it is that people who
think of themselves as Lamarckians get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamarck had two processes.  One was a rather mysterious inherent
complexifying force, which he thought was a basic physical principle
of some sort.  It does not really explain why a species getting more complex
would also be adaptive.  And of course even by as soon as 100 years later, when
physics and chemistry were much better understood, no one thought that
there was any such principle.  So the Lamarckians of the late 1800s
quietly forgot about that part of Lamarck’s theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other process was use and disuse. Organisms used their various
organs, such as eyes, limbs, leaves, etc. to try to cope with their
environments, and these strivings were inherited by their offspring
in ways that resulted in those organs growing a bit in ways that increased
adaptation.  As I explain here every year, everyone in Lamarck’s day
thought that there were such inherited effects.  Lamarck did not
invent inheritance of acquired characters, because it was already
widely accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is where modern Lamarckians go badly wrong.  They think that
it is enough to show that an environmental effect is inherited, such
as by epigenetic mechanisms.  And they think that this vindicates
Lamarck.  But to Lamarck it was the organism’s strivings to cope with
its surroundings that brought about the inherited effect.  That was what
brought about the directionality of the change, in the direction of
adaptation.  A fish tried to swim, and as it used its fins they grew
larger and stronger in its descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just showing an environmental effect would not give this directionality.
If your grandfather experienced a famine, and epigenetic inheritance
resulted in some effect on you, why should we think that these would
make you more resistant to famine?  Rather than, say, increasing your
susceptibility to cancer or heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Lamarckians have not only thrown out Lamarck’s inherent complexifying
force, they misunderstand him as merely invoking inheritance of environmental
effects.  By doing that they also abandon any attempt to explain
why change is biased toward adaptation.  Lamarck would not recognize
their theory.  His was wrong, but it at least addressed the big issue,
Modern Lamarckians don’t even try to do that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">It has been customary for me to write a post every 1st of August celebrating the anniversary of the scientist who was, as far as I can see, the first evolutionary biologist.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistling_duck&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dendrocygna viduata&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – white-faced whistling ducks, Botswana. The photographer writes, &quot;Here is a trio of white-faced whistling ducks. It’s not a particularly scientifically informative shot, but it’s one of my all-time favorite photos. Whistling ducks, on the other hand, are interesting from a number of perspectives. They’re the sister group of all other Anatidae, and they’re a very old genus: genetic divergence within &lt;i&gt;Dendrocygna&lt;/i&gt; is approximately equal to that within the rest of Anatidae. And yet they all look pretty much alike, so we have a fine example of morphological stasis. That may also be the reason that white-faced whistling ducks, with fairly sedentary habits, are nevertheless found in both Africa and South America with no recognized subspecific variation. (Fulvous whistling ducks &lt;i&gt;D. bicolor&lt;/i&gt; are worse: they’re found in North and South America, Africa, and India, still with no subspecies.)&quot;

The photographer writes, &quot;Some references list this as a subspecies of &lt;i&gt;Euphydryas chalcedona&lt;/i&gt; (chalcedon or variable checkerspot).  I am not a butterfly expert and this is my best attempt at identification.&quot;

It was nice to see some new names as well as old friends. With assistance from Our Wife and Harshest Critic, we chose 8, which we display below the Figurative Fold. We chose the photographs more on the basis of their pictorial quality than on their scientific interest. The text, if any, was written by the photographers and lightly edited for consistency. The majority of finalists are either macros or close-ups, so we did not define a macro category, as we had suggested in the “RFP.” The finalists are presented in alphabetical order of last name. Please look through their photographs before voting for your favorite. Polling will close Friday, July 30, at approximately noon MDT, and we will display the winner at noon Monday, August 2. Please remember that this is a photography contest, not a popularity contest, and discourage your friends from enlisting others specifically to vote for you.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Double Rainbow</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/07/double-rainbow.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Double Rainbow" /><published>2021-07-12T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-12T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/07/double-rainbow</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/07/double-rainbow.html">&lt;p&gt;Photograph by &lt;strong&gt;Ivy Turner&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s nice about this picture, besides that it is a nice picture, is that it shows a bright sky inside the &lt;i&gt;primary rainbow&lt;/i&gt; and outside the &lt;i&gt;secondary rainbow&lt;/i&gt;. These occur because (for the primary bow) droplets of water reflect light at all angles inside the primary bow, but the rays bunch up at the angle of the bow and give a bright dividing line between inside and outside; you may see a nice, if complicated, drawing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/File:Raindrop_wave.jpg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Rays are likewise reflected at all angles outside the secondary bow but bunch up at the angle of the bow. The bows are colored because the index of refraction of the water droplets varies with color, but that is another subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.
