&lt;p&gt;I clicked on the link and found, sadly, several papers by people that were probably starting their careers. Then there were a couple of absolute crackpot papers. One featured a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medwinpublishers.com/IJPBP/the-saint-loup-of-the-col-du-fam-a-smilodon-caught-in-a-lava-bubble.pdf&quot;&gt;weird claim&lt;/a&gt; about a supposed saber-tooth cat fossil, that was  comically just weathered rocks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia&quot;&gt;pareidolia&lt;/a&gt;, no actual bones), but the topper was this “&lt;a href=&quot;https://medwinpublishers.com/IJPBP/Proving-that-Dinosaurs-are-Distant-Ancestors-of-Humans–The-East-Asian-Locus-of-Evolution-that-disproves-definitively-the-Out-of-Africa-Theory.pdf&quot;&gt;Research Article&lt;/a&gt;” that claims humans are the descendants of dinosaurs!

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 1&lt;/strong&gt; Quaternary structure of a pore-forming membranous protein. The subunits (different colors) form a multimeric complex. The structure of the unique protein URF-13 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus_alpha_toxin &quot;&gt;quite similar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;small&gt;(CC-BY-SA-3.0.)&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Discovery Institute, principal advocate of the Intelligent Design (ID) movement in the US, attempts to invalidate scientific results demonstrating that so-called &lt;i&gt;irreducibly complex (IC)&lt;/i&gt; biological traits can evolve naturally. According to the ID protagonist Michael Behe (1996), a system is &lt;i&gt;by definition&lt;/i&gt; irreducibly complex if it consists of several specifically interacting components which together produce a function such that the removal of any single component leads to the failure of this function. Most biochemical systems are irreducibly complex in that sense. Since they cannot be less complex without losing their function, unguided natural processes based on random mutations and selection cannot build them up gradually, according to Behe. Instead, multiple coordinated mutations would be required &lt;i&gt;simultaneously&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behe postulates that a stepwise evolution of such systems is too improbable to have happened if more than two coordinated mutations, two specific binding sites among proteins, or two specific interdependencies between the parts of a system were established in one fell swoop. Such systems are beyond the “edge of evolution,” Behe says, and need an intelligent creator. This is the so-called &lt;i&gt;argument from irreducible complexity&lt;/i&gt; (IC argument).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, within the last 25 years, ID advocates were faced with more and more logical arguments and empirical data which made apparent that their perception of how evolution works is untenable. One intriguing example is the evolution of a mitochondrial gene in the corn plant &lt;i&gt;Zea mays&lt;/i&gt; named &lt;i&gt;T-URF13&lt;/i&gt; which encodes a ligand-gated pore forming receptor protein called URF13 protein (Hunt 2007).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This membrane protein evolved in cultivars bred for male sterility called &lt;i&gt;Texas cytoplasmatic male-sterile maize&lt;/i&gt; (cms-T maize). Data show that T-URF13 has arisen by rearrangements involving recombination events from two different fragments of the mitochondrial gene coding for &lt;i&gt;26S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; (see Fig. 2–4). The latter is a special type of non-coding but functional RNA molecule, which is a pivotal component of ribosomes, essential to all cells. In short, male sterility in the cms-T cytotype is linked to the chimeric mitochondrial gene T-URF13 (Bosacchi et al. 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 2&lt;/strong&gt; The origin of the T-URF13 region. This figure shows the mitochondrial 26S rRNA gene in maize, and T-URF13 at the bottom. In between are depictions of the two segments that pieced together to form T-urf13. Both segments originated from the same strand of 26S rRNA. The question mark denotes a small part of T-URF13 for which no homologous sequence could be identified. Most likely, it arose by non-homologous DNA repair processes during the recombination process. &lt;small&gt;Figure from Hunt (2007).&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, the URF13 protein comprises various distinct, specifically interacting elements that are functionally independent of each other. But all of them are needed to accomplish its specific function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The URF13 molecules have specific contact regions organizing themselves to a multimeric protein complex in the membrane (Fig. 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The complex forms an ion channel switching between two defined conformational shapes which open and close the ion channel. This trait requires additional specific complex boundary conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protein complex comprises a specific binding site for certain signaling molecules that open or close the channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;URF13 thus displays all fundamental properties of gated ion channels, which, interacting with other transport proteins, control the uptake or excretion of substances into or out of cells. It was found that the sensitivity of cms-T maize for the toxin of the fungus &lt;i&gt;Bipolaris maydis&lt;/i&gt; is also linked to this property: The toxin binds to URF13 protein and opens the ion channel, resulting in a massive loss of vital ions such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Braun et al. 1989). There is some evidence that an analogous mechanism is responsible for the male sterility (Levings 1990, p. 947). URF13 protein specifically reduces mitochondrial activity in the tapetum cells of the anthers. The resulting lack of energy leads to the degeneration of the tapetum cells. This suggests that a signaling molecule inside the tapetum cells also binds to URF13 protein and opens the ion channel, leading to the loss of energy carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the pivotal point? Notably, according to Behe, those specifically interacting parts and their coordinated binding sites constitute an irreducibly complex system. Intriguingly, the URF13 protein is equivalent, regarding its complexity and functional role, to another irreducibly complex three-component system discussed by Behe (1996, pp.108–110); see Hunt (2007). But whereas Behe asserts that billions of years would not suffice to get such systems naturally, URF13 evolved within a ridiculously short period of less than a hundred years, barely a blink in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, Lents (2019) criticized Michael Behe’s new book &lt;i&gt;Darwin Devolves&lt;/i&gt; and advocated T-URF13 as a result of “random tinkering.” The natural evolution of such a system from functionally unrelated genes which do not even encode proteins (and never did so in their history) indeed disproves Behe’s IC argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The response of the evangelical Discovery Institute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McLatchie (2019) tries to invalidate the T-URF13 protein as an example for the evolvability of irreducibly complex systems. He summarizes his refutation in four points (given below in different order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is exceedingly unlikely that T-URF13 arose &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; by unguided mutations. This, in itself, is a &lt;i&gt;prima facie&lt;/i&gt; reason to consider alternative explanations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The T-URF13 evolutionary claim is a “just-so story,” and no demonstration is offered of “textbook” evolutionary mechanisms accounting for its origins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T-URF13 turns out to be a deleterious feature, rather than one that is beneficial to the organism. Therefore, the case is possibly consistent with Behe’s thesis in &lt;i&gt;Darwin Devolves&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;URF13 is a mitochondrial protein regulated by a nuclear gene, suggesting a scheme where T-URF13 did not arise from scratch, but arose instead from a “devolutionary” process which broke the regulatory mechanism of some normally useful protein.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The flawed probability argument&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main objection against an “unguided” evolutionary origin of T-URF13 refers to the well-known probability argument. The premise is as follows: Neither the phylogenetic timeline nor the limited number of individuals involved seems sufficient (in such a case) for the emergence of an irreducibly complex system, since it allegedly requires synchronized, complex mutational events consisting of several independent steps. Yet such evolutionary processes obviously &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we will see, all data support the finding that the irreducibly complex URF13 protein emerged within a few decades from sequences lacking any genuine protein-coding capability. That supports the thesis that gene sequences which accomplish irreducibly complex functions are not as improbable as Behe supposes. The immunization tactic of the Discovery Institute, once again, aims at disputing the evidence, which refutes their premise, by referencing to just the same, obviously flawed, probability argument!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such a combination of events in, to borrow Hunt’s words, ‘one fell swoop’ does indeed seem highly improbable to occur by chance. This is especially the case given that it is estimated that only 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt; organisms have lived in the entire history of life on Earth … That is too few by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; for T-URF13 to evolve de novo. And, of course, if we consider the numbers of eukaryotes, or individuals of maize, the number of trials available to generate a complex feature like T-URF13 is drastically reduced by many orders of magnitude. In fact, surely such a strong improbability should prima facie cause us to consider alternative explanations to the one offered by Hunt, namely, that the T-URF13 ion-gated channel arose by chance ‘in one fell swoop.’ [McLatchie (2019)]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a circular argument that can be used to reject &lt;i&gt;all conceivable evidence&lt;/i&gt; for the origin of irreducibly complex systems &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt;! It is therefore clear that the probabilistic calculations are based on false premises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a couple of friends sitting at a table and playing cards. One of the players notes the order in which the cards are dealt. Then the probability of the cards appearing in exactly that order is calculated. The probability turns out to be so small that the friends could have played cards since the Big Bang without ever being dealt the same card sequence again (Kitcher 2007, p. 93). Nevertheless, the cards were dealt exactly in this order the very first time! This tells us that the &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; probability of the occurrence of any specific event does not tell us whether it actually happened or not. Literally any event can be calculated as improbably as you wish, after the fact. But since it actually happened, the probability of this specific event equals 1. The fallacy of the probability argument is that it presumes the necessity of reaching a &lt;i&gt;pre-specified&lt;/i&gt; target. This is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could object that every conceivable card sequence would serve the players to continue their game, while in biology only a small fraction of all mutations (of all “deals”) is actually “allowed” or functional. Nonetheless, there is no need to demand pre-specified mutations or pre-defined functions. Instead, there are countless potentially functional mutations, which are completely unknown to us. For example, if every thousandth or only every millionth double mutation has a positive effect under certain conditions, the statement that a specific double mutation occurs with a probability of only 10&lt;sup&gt;-20&lt;/sup&gt; becomes meaningless. This historically unique event will be just one of an unthinkable number of possibilities to benefit the organism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why does the Discovery Institute keep on overusing the same flawed probability calculations, which correspond to the GIGO concept from computer science (which means: “garbage in, garbage out”), for decades?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Note that there are at least five discrete evolutionary events that must occur in order for &lt;i&gt;T-URF13&lt;/i&gt; to arise: First two sections of DNA … must be brought together by random mutation. But this alone is not sufficient to produce a functional gene. The second step is that the atp 6 promoter must be brought into a position to control the gene. Third, fourth, and fifth: The three binding sites needed for T-URF13 to operate must evolve … Presumably, unless all of these events occur, T-URF13 cannot function to provide any selectable advantage in certain contexts. [McLatchie (2019)]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what? Again, for two reasons there is no “probabilistic hurdle” at all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behe is wrong in assuming that there are pre-specified target sequences evolution has to “work towards”. There are many &lt;i&gt;completely different sequences&lt;/i&gt; that could serve to accomplish a particular function. Even when starting from random sequences, one or two mutations are often sufficient to gain a particular (or a total new) function (Tonkin et al. 2008; De Kraker &amp;amp; Gershenzon 2011; Yona et al 2018). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The respective mutations have to arise neither simultaneously nor in one single organism. Instead, there is a contemporary, parallel accumulation of random mutations in thousands of individuals which share a gene pool. Then, the different mutations can be combined via sexual recombination in various ways. Such a parallel process tremendously accelerates the evolution of innovations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Monte Carlo experiments do show that there is a good chance of producing irreducibly complex systems – even if that would require three, four, or even more “matching” mutations at the same time&lt;/i&gt; (Trotter et al. 2014). As the authors demonstrate, the evolution of such complex innovations is particularly promising by using genes that are under weak selection pressure like cryptic genes. The number of cryptic genes in a given genome can be rather high. For instance, the proportion of endogenous retroviruses in the human genome alone amounts to at least 8 %. Finlay (2006) speaks of 400,000 insertion points – a huge playing field for evolution!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We summarize that probability calculations against evolution are nonsense since we do not know the entire number of viable variants in the protein space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A mathematical argument against evolution requires a detailed knowledge of both the probabilistic and geometric structures of protein space (or possibly genotype space, depending on the context). This knowledge is always lacking in practical situation. When you see a probability calculation in some piece of anti-evolution writing, you can be certain that it is based on biologically unrealistic assumptions.” (Rosenhouse 2022, p. 160)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the evolutionary explanation a “just-so story”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Discovery Institute claims that homology or sequence similarities are “not enough to establish an evolutionary pathway”; Hunt’s mechanistic scenario is a “just-so-story” that did not prove T-URF13 arose through recombinant evolutionary events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[H]ow does Hunt know that &lt;i&gt;T-URF13&lt;/i&gt; evolved by unguided mutational events from scratch? He doesn’t. Or, at the very least, he has not established that &lt;i&gt;T-URF13&lt;/i&gt; evolved by blind evolution.... If an event is observed to have happened that is highly improbable, having taken into account the available probabilistic resources, that in itself is evidence against the chance hypothesis, and it should drive us to investigate other possible options. [McLatchie (2019)]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very odd argument, since ID proponents always demanded evolutionary (breeding) experiments to falsify the IC argument! The moment they are confronted with such an experiment, they pirouette and demand more. But what more? The evolution of mechanisms at a molecular level is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; reconstructed &lt;i&gt;indirectly&lt;/i&gt; (by hypothetico-deductive reasoning). Therefore, their demand for “more” is either naive empiricist or an immunization strategy. What do they expect – a microscopic film exposure of how the genes fused together? No one sits in a cell nucleus and watches in real time how mutations happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Hunt was able to show that T-URF13 evolved by recombinant processes during the breeding of certain maize varieties. Crucially, T-URF13 is unique to cms-T maize plants (Von Allmen et al. 1991; Rhoads et al. 1995; Dill et al. 1997; Arun et al. 2011; Yi et al. 2021). No other sources for T-URF13 except the two mitochondrial DNA sequences we will discuss below have been found. Additionally, data exclude exceptional pollen transmission of organelles or multiple horizontal gene transfer events as the source of T-URF13 (Bosacchi et al. 2015).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: If the gene did not just fall out of the blue (and oddly enough, turned out to be identical for 94 % of the ORF* length to pre-existing fragments of the mitochondrial genome), we cannot help but state that it arose (de novo) from available resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What other mechanisms than unguided evolutionary processes could be brought into play? Note that the experiments worked exclusively by selective breeding, that is by a Darwinian mechanism. &lt;i&gt;T-URF13 is neither a result of “rational design,” nor of directed evolution. No intentional processes were involved except the selection for pollen sterile variants.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, all biochemical mechanisms that are involved in the origination of T-URF13 are well understood.†  Hunt (2019) correctly mentioned in his response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recombination has been studied for decades, and we know enough about the enzymes to know that the attendant chemical mechanisms are all that are needed to promote the genomic shuffling that gave rise to T-URF13.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are able to identify the homologs of the T-URF13 sequence in the ancestor’s genome, the recombination scenario is currently the only plausible explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does T-URF13 originate by a “devolutionary process”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could one argue that URF13 admittedly evolved but originated from an &lt;i&gt;ancestral&lt;/i&gt; pore-forming protein? In that case, the highly specific interdependencies of URF13 would have pre-existed somewhere in the DNA. Therefore, a simple mutation could have restored the receptor gene or altered its activity and specificity. Indeed, the Discovery Institute prefers speculations about a pre-existing gene that became T-URF13 by some so-called &lt;i&gt;devolutionary process&lt;/i&gt; – whatever this may mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; One scenario is that the &lt;i&gt;URF-13&lt;/i&gt; complex is involved in some other process, and that it became broken such that it was no longer properly regulated. Indeed, the first identification of &lt;i&gt;T-URF13&lt;/i&gt; long pre-dates the sequencing of the maize genome in the early 2000s (Chandler and Brendel, 2002; Schnable et al., 2009; Soderlund et al., 2009; Gore et al., 2009; Vielle-Calzada et al. 2009). It thus was impossible to determine whether the &lt;i&gt;T-URF13&lt;/i&gt; gene had indeed arisen &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; ‘from scratch,’ or whether it was already present and doing something else. [McLatchie (2019)]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no evidence supports these scenarios. There is no reason in sight to pursue them at all. By now, more than a hundred crop genomes, including mitochondriomes, have been &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; sequenced and are available in public databases. There is no gene, there is no sequence resembling T-URF13 except the mentioned 26S rDNA gene (plus the adjacent intergenic region).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the sequences of thousands of genes coding for rRNA are known from many taxa. Among them is not a single example of any pre-existing protein-coding gene with significant structural similarity to rDNA, with a structure which is even remotely resembling T-URF13. Neither is any example known so far of an exaptation of rDNA-fragments for coding a membrane protein. This is indeed the first one! In distinct contrast to the claims of the Discovery Institute, a scenario that proposes the devolution of a pre-existing protein-coding gene is nothing but a just-so story, not supported by any data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A renewed similarity search (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi&quot;&gt;BLAST&lt;/a&gt; on May 26 2022, carried out by A.B.) confirmed the result. The origin of the sequences coding for T-URF13 was identified without a trace of doubt: The two major fragments form part of the maize gene for the 26S rRNA and the adjacent non-coding region, respectively. There are no better and more specific search hits than these two perfect hits. Moreover, there is not any other significant hit than those in 26S rDNAs (see the Appendix). Also, in protein databases, there are no significant hits for any part of the URF13 protein apart from URF13 itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a “hidden” protein-coding frame inside the 26S rDNA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned, T-URF13 is a chimera of two parts of the mitochondrial chromosome: an intergenic region that is not transcribed and therefore does not code for a protein (yellow), and part of the 26S rDNA gene encoding the 26S rRNA (green). The latter gene is transcribed into RNA but not translated. That means it also does not code for a protein (Pring &amp;amp; Lonsdale 1989).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, (26S) rDNA encoding for (26S) rRNA molecules does not contain a protein-coding reading frame – and obviously never did. Why do we know this? If one compares the coding regions (ORFs) of &lt;i&gt;protein-coding genes&lt;/i&gt; from different species, one repeatedly finds so-called &lt;i&gt;InDels&lt;/i&gt; (= insertions or deletions) of 3, 6, 9, etc. bases, that is, integral multiples of 3. On the other hand, if one compares the coding regions of &lt;i&gt;genes that code for functional RNA molecules&lt;/i&gt;, particularly the ribosomal RNAs and specifically intergenic regions, one finds InDels that do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; comply with the “3-step-rule”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biological explanation for this phenomenon is simple: Tiny insertions and deletions usually produce no or little effects in many regions of ribosomal RNAs, in proteins, and especially in intergenic regions. However, InDels containing 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, etc. bases shift the reading frame of an ORF. From the affected point on, the protein is completely changed – and almost always loses its biological function. As a result, such mutations in protein coding parts (ORFs) are negatively selected. &lt;i&gt;Consequently, the fact that rRNAs are not subject to the “3-step-rule” is direct evidence that such rRNAs/rDNA never coded for proteins. Therefore, the present state of knowledge is that the highly specific T-URF13 gene evolved from sequences which never coded for proteins in evolutionary history.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do deleterious features invalidate the evolutionary argument?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper goes to some lengths to explain that URF13 is not a beneficial but a deleterious feature – a “loss-of-function change” – for the domestic plant. However, the conclusion from this fact amounts to an attempt to mislead readers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is thus quite telling that, as their flagship example of a new protein complex arising &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;, Arthur Hunt, Nathan Lents, and others choose to promote a system that in fact causes harm to the organism that bears it. Surely if there were a better example — one that is functionally advantageous to the organism — then they would be touting that instead. [McLatchie (2019)]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this “loss-of-function change” is not a case of structural &lt;i&gt;degradation&lt;/i&gt; but a case of structural &lt;i&gt;formation&lt;/i&gt; caused by &lt;i&gt;a completely new protein and IC system&lt;/i&gt;. Such formative structures occur, under special conditions, also in the wild: As Hunt (2019b) mentions, male sterility is a feature of so-called gynodioecious plants. In gynodioecious plants, females are male sterile, often via mechanisms that recall those that underlie male sterility in cms-T corn. Therefore, such structures can evolve not only by artificial, but also by natural selection. Hunt (2019b): “To claim that this trait causes harm is to badly misunderstand many aspects of plant biology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, it is impossible to believe that McLatchie does not know that the effect of selective forces does not depend upon a “benefit” in the sense of a quasi-technical optimization, but solely upon a fitness benefit. There is simply no causal link between mutations and mutation mechanisms on the one hand, and the question how selection works on them on the other. There is also no link between the complexity of mutational pathways and the question if the product is beneficial or deleterious. For the discussion of the probability of an event to occur in evolution, it is completely irrelevant if this event might be labeled “advantageous” or “deleterious” in any “technical” sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once again, the question whether a trait can be considered “beneficial” or “harmful” from a functional point of view, is completely independent of the question, how complex it is and how it arose&lt;/i&gt;. A machine gun can be considered a harmful tool, surgical instruments as beneficial. That does not mean one is developed easier than the other one. The fact that counts is that URF13 is irreducibly complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does URF13 originate from a signal peptide of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The institute’s final contention is a prime example of an argumentative chaos. Below, the argument is quoted in full. Notice, for example, the phrase: “…an insertion of DNA into a pre-existing gene that was itself a membrane protein for mitochondria…” There is a gene that concurrently is a protein? That’s remarkable! Or look at this: “RLF32_ARATH is a signal peptide for import into mitochondria for a gene in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.” Experts know that the plant gene is not imported into mitochondria but rather its product, a protein. But anybody without expertise will become hopelessly confused. Just savor the whole passage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Proteins embedded in the mitochondrial membrane are synthesized in the cytosol, and therefore they possess an alpha helical a[m]phipathic coil at the N-terminus that is recognized by transport complexes (see this section from the textbook &lt;i&gt;Molecular Biology of the Cell&lt;/i&gt; for details). It follows that there ought to be a signal peptide for mitochondrial membrane insertion. That implies that what we have is actually an insertion of DNA into a pre-existing gene that was itself a membrane protein for mitochondria and perhaps a channel — and perhaps a regulated channel since it is affected by nuclear genes. A tool called Signal-BLAST, available at the website of the Center for Applied Molecular Engineering (CAME), allows a user to identify signal peptides in a protein sequence (Frank and Sippl, 2008). Entering the FASTA file for T-URF13 yields a result output of a signal peptide, putative cleavage site after AA 35 (by similarity to RLF32_ARATH). RLF32_ARATH is a signal peptide for import into mitochondria for a gene in Arabidopsis. That protein is involved in cell-cell signaling by way of Ca++ influx. What all this means is that T-URF13 probably came from a fully functional, pre-existing gene, and did not arise &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;. [McLatchie (2019)]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic argument, disentangled from the chaos, runs as follows: An analytic tool which allows “high-performance signal peptide prediction based on sequence alignment techniques” shows that the mitochondrial gene T-URF13 contains a sequence similar to one coding a signal peptide in the plant &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The claim is that the peptide is needed to transport a mitochondrial membrane protein which is synthesized in the cytosol (the cell body) into the membrane of mitochondria. That must happen because the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein is located in the cell nucleus. Most of the genes coding mitochondrial proteins indeed are located there. Also, the membrane protein which contains the signal peptide in question forms a regulated ion channel. It is said that it regulates the influx of Ca2+ ions into the mitochondria of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, so the argument, T-URF13 could have originated from such an ion channel gene and does not have to be evolved &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can refute the argument easily. Hunt (2019a), for good reasons, has rated it as “jaw-droppingly bad.”‡ For one thing, the T-URF13 gene is located not in the nucleus but in the mitochondrial genome. Thus, no import into mitochondria happens, neither for URF13 protein nor for T-URF13. That is simply a matter of fact. There is no trace of T-URF13 or anything similar in the nuclear genome. So why should a hypothetical predecessor gene code for a signal peptide which transfers cytosol proteins from outside into the mitochondrial membrane? That simply makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the claim that the analytic tool detects a gene sequence similar to that coding for a signal peptide known from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; is dubious. The match is incomplete at best. Strangely enough, the particular &lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt; protein, to which the signal peptide in question belongs, is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; transported into mitochondria but into the plasma membrane, so there is something seriously wrong with the whole claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there is no significant match between this protein family and URF13. There is even no remotely significant match with &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; protein in the whole protein database (Protein BLAST @ NCBI: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins). Obviously, whatever the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt; genes are and do, there is no evolutionary connection to T-URF13. But only experts in molecular genetics realize that the so-called data are fabricated. Everybody else is overwhelmed by the maze of technical jargon. That is the Discovery Institute’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix: The mysterious PKT5 “gene”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a recent BLAST search corroborated the notion that T-URF13 had been composed of two fragments of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of maize. The yellow and the green region (Fig. 3) perfectly match to other parts of the mtDNA as described. The red part finds no match in the maize nuclear genome or mitogenome corroborating the notion that this part has been created by mitochondrial DNA double strand repair. The shortness of this part further supports that idea. Furthermore there are quite a few nearly perfect matches simply by chance in very different organisms – as to be expected by the shortness of this part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a very surprising full-length match with a gene in a male-sterile lineage of carrot &lt;i&gt;Daucus carota&lt;/i&gt; (Fig. 5). Kanzaki et al. (1991) named it &lt;i&gt;PKT5 gene&lt;/i&gt;. Their paper seems to suggest that very similar (in fact: identical) rearrangements took place independently in maize and carrots to produce male-sterile lines and a full-length match with T-URF13. Since this is not a particularly satisfying explanation, how can this be conundrum be explained? Some facts will help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The alignment contains only two mismatches, but beyond that eight (!) single-base deletions – all of them in &lt;i&gt;D. carota&lt;/i&gt; PKT5. However, mismatch mutations occur 4 to 10 times more frequent than insertions or deletions. Moreover, they should have occurred in both genes at about the same rate. Here, however, the green and yellow parts of T-URF13 match perfectly to maize mitochondrial DNA, whereas all mismatches occur in the carrot “gene”. Such characteristics are typical for sequencing errors. This is further substantiated by the fact that all of those deletions would destroy almost half of the open reading frame creating a substantially changed protein, which surely cannot work like URF13 protein.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The similarity of &lt;i&gt;D. carota&lt;/i&gt; PKT5 to maize mtDNA is almost perfect on the one hand. On the other hand, its similarity to &lt;i&gt;D. carota&lt;/i&gt; mtDNA is much weaker as easily can be seen in BLAST search. How should a carrot gene arise from maize mitochondrial genome? The only possibility would be &lt;i&gt;horizontal gene transfer&lt;/i&gt; which is also not convincing since there is no further evidence.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The experimental approach of Kanzaki et al. is questionable since their hybridisation experiment does not make sense: T-URF13 has been assembled from maize mitochondrial genome and shows – except for the red part – perfect sequence identity. So, it will hybridise to any mitochondrial genome with sufficient sequence similarity. So why even try&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;To corroborate the mere existence of carrot PKT5 gene, the presence of the coded protein has to be demonstrated. To our knowledge, this has not happened so far.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Neukamm_Figure_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fig. 5&lt;/strong&gt; Alignment between Zea mays T-URF13 (top line) and Daucus carota PKT5 ORF (bottom line). Colours correspond to Figs. 3 and 4.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all does not make any sense. By the way: It also does not fit into a design scenario (unless you would like to argue: “The Designer in his unfathomable will can do whatever he/she/it wants”). Such patterns, however, are typical of artefacts produced experimentally: mix-up of clones and sequencing errors, which in most cases are never cured in the databases. First author (A.B.) experienced such cases during his time in the human genome project – to mention only three examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;At that time, a significant portion of clones from cDNA and gDNA libraries were interchanged (meaning the accession or ordering number was assigned to a wrong clone). &lt;/li&gt; 

&lt;li&gt;During assembly of chromosomes from reads always some sequences fall out of the alignments for a simple reason. They originated from different species and erroneously were inserted into the processing pipeline. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Erroneous sequences produced either by PCR/cloning artefacts or by low quality sequence runs. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, LIMS (Laboratory information management systems) have reduced such errors by some orders of magnitude. The respective paper (Kanzaki et al.), however, is from 1991, when such systems did not exist or were in their infancy. It fits well into this scenario that the authors were provided with a cloned version of T-URF13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: Obviously, the carrot PKT5 gene simply does not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* ORF (Open Reading Frame) is the protein-coding region of a gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;†They even explain the origin of the red marked intermediate area illustrated in Fig. 3 and 4: When mismatched ends are assembled (via non-homologous double strand break repair mechanisms), the sequence at the junction often changes rather randomly. That is why no significant homologs are found in the databases for this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‡Further pseudo-arguments against the T-URF13 example presented by the “Uncommon Descent” guys are debunked by Hunt: https://www.ag-evolutionsbiologie.net/html/2019/T-URF13.html&lt;/p&gt;

The Discovery Institute, principal advocate of the Intelligent Design (ID) movement in the US, attempts to invalidate scientific results demonstrating that so-called irreducibly complex (IC) biological traits can evolve naturally. According to the ID protagonist Michael Behe (1996), a system is by definition irreducibly complex if it consists of several specifically interacting components which together produce a function such that the removal of any single component leads to the failure of this function. Most biochemical systems are irreducibly complex in that sense. Since they cannot be less complex without losing their function, unguided natural processes based on random mutations and selection cannot build them up gradually, according to Behe. Instead, multiple coordinated mutations would be required simultaneously. Behe postulates that a stepwise evolution of such systems is too improbable to have happened if more than two coordinated mutations, two specific binding sites among proteins, or two specific interdependencies between the parts of a system were established in one fell swoop. Such systems are beyond the “edge of evolution,” Behe says, and need an intelligent creator. This is the so-called argument from irreducible complexity (IC argument). However, within the last 25 years, ID advocates were faced with more and more logical arguments and empirical data which made apparent that their perception of how evolution works is untenable. One intriguing example is the evolution of a mitochondrial gene in the corn plant Zea mays named T-URF13 which encodes a ligand-gated pore forming receptor protein called URF13 protein (Hunt 2007).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism: Review</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/Mathematical-Anti-Evolutionism.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism: Review" /><published>2022-06-14T12:07:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-14T12:07:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/Mathematical-Anti-Evolutionism</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/Mathematical-Anti-Evolutionism.html">&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Rosenhouse’s newest book, &lt;i&gt;The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism&lt;/i&gt;, is a mathematics book, not a book on evolution, and not a book on creationism or theology. Though the author plainly believes in – no: though the author plainly &lt;i&gt;accepts&lt;/i&gt; evolution, his main purpose is to show that the mathematical arguments of anti-evolutionists are flatly wrong, rather than to defend evolution explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rosenhouse&quot;&gt;Jason Rosenhouse&lt;/a&gt; is an American author who has written several books, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199744633.001.0001/acprof-9780199744633&quot;&gt;Among the Creationists: Dispatches from the Anti-Evolutionist Front Line&lt;/a&gt;. His experience as a mathematician and of actually wading into the swamp of creationism make him uniquely qualified to have written the present book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I took away from this book – and which I thought should have been stressed more – was Prof. Rosenhouse’s distinction between Track-1 and Track-2 explanations. This very important distinction is not shown in what looked like an otherwise comprehensive index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Track-1 explanation is “our intuitive understanding,” a descriptive explanation, possibly written in plain English. A Track-2 explanation is a rigorous mathematical exposition, including precise definitions and proved theorems. Track 1 is not definitive; as I would put it, Track 1 gives you a hunch and guides you toward developing a mathematical proof. Track 2 is the rigorous mathematical proof itself. You need both tracks, because, if you stick to Track 1, you will find it too easy to make “logical oversights.” If you cannot prove something rigorously, then you have not proved it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists typically develop a Track-1 explanation, then simply rephrase it as a Track-2 explanation, but they do not prove anything rigorously. They might, for example, note that proteins are extremely complex and therefore so improbable that they could not have arisen by chance. They then apply combinatorial analysis and indeed calculate what they set out to calculate: that proteins almost certainly did not originate by chance. No one thinks that they did. Rather, they originated by a complex sequence of processes that cannot be modeled as a simple combinatorics problem, à la the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkyard_tornado&quot;&gt;tornado in a junkyard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the creationists’ supposed Track-2 explanation is mere window dressing that repeats the Track-1 explanation using mathematical notation in place of words. Indeed, as we see as we progress through the book, all the creationists’ mathematics, bar none, is sophisticated gobbledygook designed to appear rigorous to people who would not understand a word of it. That the purveyors of such window dressing accept it as proof is testament to the power of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&quot;&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of intelligent-design creationism relies on irreducible complexity, the claim that a system has well matched, interacting parts, all of which are essential to the functioning of the system. That is, if any one of the parts is broken or removed, the system will not function. Professor Rosenhouse explains how the claim is false by showing how an eye might evolve step by step until it consists of well matched, interacting parts, all of which are critical to its functioning. But where he jabs the knife in and twists it is in this quotation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clever marketing to refer to these systems as &quot;irreducibly complex.&quot; A more accurate description is &quot;easily broken,&quot; and his [Michael Behe's] argument could then be rephrased like this: &quot;The prevalence of easily broken systems in nature is strong evidence of intelligent design.&quot; In &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; form the argument is not terribly persuasive.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is not to like about a book that comes up with gems like this one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or this one, after discussing Kelvin’s estimate of the age of the earth and the possibly spurious “proof” that a bumblebee cannot fly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If copious physical evidence suggests that something has occurred, but someone's mathematical model says the thing is impossible, then it is probably the model that is wrong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a section on “The perils of long-term modeling,” he notes similarly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; We have copious physical evidence that modern life forms are the end results of a lengthy evolutionary process.… And since no mathematical model could possibly include enough of nature's complexity to be convincing, we are not worried that a few back-of-the-envelope calculations will provide a good reason for abandoning that hypothesis [that is, the theory of evolution].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A section called “The basic argument from improbability” explains in some detail why simple combinatorial analysis is not a good model for the evolution of proteins. I cannot go into detail, but Prof. Rosenhouse notes that, given enough opportunity, even improbable events actually happen (an occurrence with odds of one million to one, for example, happens eight times a day in New York), so it is not enough to say that a particular protein is so improbable that a special explanation is required. Those who favor what Prof. Rosenhouse calls the Basic Argument from Improbability provide no argument in favor of a special explanation, but merely (blindly, if I may say so) apply combinatorial analysis where it is completely inapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the same chapter, Prof. Rosenhouse takes on William Dembski’s concept of complex specified information. There is too much to discuss here, but I will note that Dembski requires us to distinguish designed “patterns” from undesigned. Professor Rosenhouse notes, however:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; We know what mountains look like when we do not carve faces into them, and that makes it easy to recognize Mount Rushmore as something designed. This background knowledge is precisely what we lack in the biological context. No one has intuitions about what will arise after billions of years of evolution starting from a relatively simple sort of life. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one of the main stumbling blocks in Dembski’s analysis is that he thinks we can recognize design in the same way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it&quot;&gt;Mr. Justice Stewart thinks he can recognize obscenity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more about Dembski, including his misapplication of the No Free Lunch theorems, which is well worth reading. I liked the chapter on thermodynamics as well, though the editor in me feels obliged to point out that heat is &lt;i&gt;transferred&lt;/i&gt;, not necessarily &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;radiated&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. Professor Rosenhouse notes that the second law of thermodynamics does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; preclude increases or decreases of entropy. He correctly inveighs against conflating entropy with order and disorder, but perhaps confusingly sometimes uses disorder as an analogy to entropy. The analogy is often useful, but it is important to recognize that it is only an analogy and proves nothing; Prof. Rosenhouse notes that a jagged chunk of ice looks less orderly than a smooth pool of water, but its thermodynamic entropy is actually less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use thermodynamics to describe evolution, you have to perform a rigorous Type-2 analysis. How, asks Prof. Rosenhouse, do you calculate the change in entropy between an ancestral organism and an elephant? How do you apply the laws of thermodynamics to the theory of evolution? No one knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewer’s quibbles&lt;/strong&gt;. The book is well prepared and very readable. I found only a few errors, such as “adaption” and “few 1,000” (and Watt where it should have been watt, but that is getting &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; picky). The entropy of the ice is calculated incorrectly (p. 241); the correct calculation is left as an exercise for the reader, who is advised to remember that it is necessary to extract heat from the water before it will freeze. I thought the book possibly could have used a few more figures, but I did not particularly care for Figure 5.2, which lacks axis labels and looks too much like a graph of some quantity as a function of time; in fact, it represents some kind of protein space in 2 dimensions. Figure 6.1 also lacks axis labels; it is drawn with very thick curves whose thickness is not explained. The discussion of a thrown ball on p. 65 is not incorrect but seems to imply that the ball’s velocity increases linearly with time, a property I wish were true of my forehand drive. Finally, I was a bit put out by Prof. Rosenhouse’s disparagement, several times, of high school math classes. I do not remember exactly enjoying high school math, but I certainly recognized its importance and was not terrifically bored. An editor should have caught that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledgment and disclosure&lt;/strong&gt;. Jason Rosenhouse very kindly sent me a review copy of the book. He and I are members of the PT “Crew.” We communicated once as I was preparing this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dembski has responded to Prof. Rosenhouse’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://billdembski.com/intelligent-design/success-of-mathematics-in-advancing-intelligent-design/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism by Jason Rosenhouse, Cambridge University Press, 2022, 274 pp. Jason Rosenhouse’s newest book, The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism, is a mathematics book, not a book on evolution, and not a book on creationism or theology. Though the author plainly believes in – no: though the author plainly accepts evolution, his main purpose is to show that the mathematical arguments of anti-evolutionists are flatly wrong, rather than to defend evolution explicitly. Jason Rosenhouse is an American author who has written several books, including Among the Creationists: Dispatches from the Anti-Evolutionist Front Line. His experience as a mathematician and of actually wading into the swamp of creationism make him uniquely qualified to have written the present book. Joe Felsenstein has posted an annotated table of contents, and Prof. Rosenhouse himself has presented an essay The futility of anti-evolutionary mathematics on PT; I will not try to duplicate either of those. Additionally, if you want to get a feeling for some of the more egregious nonsense, you might want to read Has Michael Egnor shown that everything is intelligently designed?, also by Joe Felsenstein. I cannot make, um, head or tail of Dr. Egnor’s argument, except that he seems to think that if you use tossing coins in an illustrative manner, then you must think that the coins themselves were formed by natural causes.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">David Hills on the SSB vote on the Ernst Mayr Award</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/Hillis-on-Mayr-Award.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="David Hills on the SSB vote on the Ernst Mayr Award" /><published>2022-06-13T14:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-13T14:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/Hillis-on-Mayr-Award</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/Hillis-on-Mayr-Award.html">&lt;figure class=&quot;on-the-left-side&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2022/Ernst-Mayr-enhanced-6-scaled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;[Ernst Mayr with painting of Ernst Mayr.]&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Hillis wrote (originally on Facebook, June 9, 2022):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235); padding: 15px;&quot;&gt;If you are a member of the Society of Systematic Biologists, you can vote on the election of new officers and on a proposed amendment to the society’s constitution. The ballot is now open (check your e-mail if you are a member of SSB).
I strongly OPPOSE the proposed constitutional amendment, which would change the Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology to the Outstanding Student Presentation Award in Systematic Biology, for the following reasons:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ernst Mayr was a life-long champion of diversity and inclusion. He stood up against racism at a time when many others would not. Removing his name from this award would be a slap in the face of the many members who have fought to make SSB inclusive, vibrant, and diverse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ernst Mayr funded the award, and was the major benefactor of the society’s endowment, which is now used to support many of the society’s beneficial activities. He deserves recognition for his life-long support of systematics and the society, as well as his many significant contributions to broader society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ernst Mayr was one of the founders of the society, and was among the most well-respected and accomplished systematists in history. Removing his name from the award will imply to many that he did something wrong, which is the opposite of the truth. This is unfair to the legacy of Ernst Mayr, who should be an inspiration to all.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Changing the name to a generic award cheapens the award and is unfair to graduate students we wish to honor and recognize. A generic award certainly does not carry the prestige of the Ernst Mayr Award in Systematic Biology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

No one is claiming that Mayr was anything except a hero of diversity and inclusion, and an outstanding founder and accomplished benefactor of the society. Removing the names of people like Mayr from awards sends exactly the wrong message to students and members of the society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For these reasons, please vote AGAINST the constitutional amendment. &lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
Michael Egnor, by all accounts a talented neurosurgeon, has come up with an extraordinary argument at Evolution News, the Discovery Institute's site where they attempt to excise evolutionary thinking.  His argument, which is aimed at
Jason Rosenhouse's book &lt;em&gt;The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism&lt;/em&gt;, can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/06/rosenhouses-blunder-another-nonsensical-mathematical-argument-against-intelligent-design/&quot;&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;.   Thanks to Jack Krebs for pointing out this extraordinary paragraph, about Jason's analogy to coin-tossing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For Rosenhouse’s analogy to point to unintelligent causes — to Darwinian natural selection — he would have to invoke the analogy that we leave a block of silver on a table by itself and wait for it to (by erosion and wind) sculpt itself into 100 coins, each of which would then spontaneously fall off the table, and the coins that landed tails up would then spontaneously (perhaps by earthquakes!) jump back up onto the table and spontaneously fall again, with this mindless but amazingly specific cycle repeating itself until all 100 coins lay heads-up on the floor (and the floor would first have to assemble itself!). This is a fine model of Darwinian natural selection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What is Egnor trying to argue?  I think a major issue is, to what does this argument &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; apply?  Is it arguing that natural phenomena are intelligently designed, or that models of natural phenomena are intelligently designed? To
find out, first read Egnor's whole post at the link above.

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at Ken Ham’s daily Twitter posts like I do, you will see that beyond his usual anti-science spiel and promotion of his “Museum” and Ark Park, he is obsessed with complaining about Disney while simultaneously comparing his inane tourist sites to Disney. He also makes lots of posts about LGBTQ issues, especially those concerning transsexuals. Transsexuals are one of Ken’s big bugaboos and his posts indicate he thinks about them often. In any case, a Facebook post by Ken (below the fold) may indicate he is in trouble on Twitter (especially in France and Germany).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that his account says he and Answers in Genesis are on various right-wing sites including &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler&quot;&gt;Parler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeWe&quot;&gt;MeWe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettr&quot;&gt;Gettr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)&quot;&gt;Gab&lt;/a&gt;. Considering Ham and AiG’s claims to be anti-racist, one of the few things praiseworthy about him and his AiG ministry, this association with these right-wing social media is remarkable. Each of these sites caters to vile, extremist hate groups that have limited access to other social media. Facebook has reprehensible content, but at least Facebook claims to attempt to keep the worst off. Twitter is almost as bad, but seems slightly more responsible in removing the worst posts, at least for the time being. These other sites are replete with racism, Q’Anon, anti-Semitism, anti-vaxx, and numerous other dumbfery.

While I am going to write about issues peripherally related to this tragedy, rather than on the shooting itself, this is by no means intended to overlook the loss and suffering that the loved ones of the victims and, indeed, the Buffalo community as whole are continuing to deal with at this moment.

This has caused consternation among members of America’s Republican Party and the right wing media with which it is allied.  For some time now, the American Right has been making subtle, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/02/28/marjorie-taylor-greene-white-nationalist-conference/&quot;&gt;sometimes not so subtle&lt;/a&gt;, overtures to White Supremacists in order to bring them into their “big tent” as part of their political base.  Nonetheless, it remains a fact that many swing voters will be repelled by associations with such movements.  This likely explains why, immediately after the shooting, the right wing media went into overdrive trying to downplay the killer’s racial motivations and, instead, shift the blame to other less politically inconvenient targets, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamerant.com/fox-news-violent-video-games-buffalo-shooting/&quot;&gt;video games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tucker-carlson-blames-buffalo-supermarket-shooting-on-biden-mental-illness-ignores-great-replacement-theory-spread-on-fox-news/&quot;&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt;.  A question arises:  If the American Right was not courting the support of White Supremacists, then why would it be so important for them to deny the killer’s White Supremacist motivations?  I don’t really have a good answer for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, it should come as no surprise that the Discovery Institute is more than willing to lend a helping hand to this effort.  And if it provides them an opportunity to engage in their favorite pastime of Darwin bashing, so much the better.  Which explains the article posted on the Evolution News website May 16, written by the DI’s Senior Fellow, Managing Director and Vice President John G. West and bearing the eye-opening title &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/05/how-science-fueled-the-white-supremacist-mass-murderer-in-buffalo-ny/&quot;&gt;How Science Fueled the White Supremacist Mass Murderer in Buffalo, NY.&lt;/a&gt;  While acknowledging the killer’s motivation in White Supremacism and Great Replacement Theory, West goes on to state that this “doesn’t tell us anything about the roots of the shooter’s twisted beliefs. Until we start paying attention to THAT question, we are unlikely to make progress in combatting these kinds of crimes in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader can probably guess where this is going.  Despite acknowledging the tangled and incoherent mess of ideas the killer drew upon to justify his act, West decides to focus on one aspect of his attempted rationalization (emphasis is West’s):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(T)he shooter asserts that blacks “are a different subspecies of human.” Why? Because “Whites and Blacks &lt;b&gt;are separated by tens of thousands of years of evolution&lt;/b&gt;, and our genetic material is obviously very different.” (p. 14) Elsewhere he suggests that Europeans and Asians are more recently evolved than blacks (p. 17), which sounds eerily reminiscent of the view of countless racists of the past (including Charles Darwin himself) that blacks are the lowest humans on the evolutionary ladder…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To some degree, the past is coming back to haunt the scientific community. The historical connections between evolutionary biology and racism are undeniable….  To their credit, most supporters of Darwinian evolution largely abandoned their scientific racism after the civil rights era, if not earlier. The problem is that they had little positive to replace it with. Think about it: If humans truly evolved through a blind and accidental process that did not have them in mind, it’s not much of a jump to believe that some human populations must have evolved in ways superior to other human populations. Thus, a tendency toward racism was sort of built-in to evolutionary theory from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How ought one respond to such accusations?  One way to &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; respond would be to deny the kernel of truth in West’s article, which is that science, and evolutionary theory in particular, has been used through history to support ideas that we would now consider to be clearly racist, eugenics being but one example.  However, is West justified in laying particular blame on what he calls “Darwinism” for this state of affairs?  I do not believe he is.  If (Tucker Carlson notwithstanding) there now exists a consensus that no significant differences exist in terms of qualities like intelligence or moral worth between people of different ethnicities, this was not the case to nearly the same extent even a few decades ago.  And the idea that people ought to be granted different degrees of rights and privileges based on their ethnic identity, was not one that would be particularly likely to be heard at scientific meetings or conferences.  One would be at least as likely to hear it voiced from the pulpit at a religious gathering, or from the hustings during a political campaign.   That is to say, it would be more accurate to state that science is not immune to corruption by racism, rather than to claim that it holds any particular responsibility for the existence of racism.  Indeed, if one wished to argue that racism was an unavoidable and inherent aspect of religion, this could be done by pointing out how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/01/arts/from-noah-s-curse-to-slavery-s-rationale.html&quot;&gt;passages from the Old Testament have been used to justify slavery in the US&lt;/a&gt;, as just one example. If such an argument is fallacious, it is surely no more so than the one West tries to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West goes on to write “The scientific community’s rejection of scientific racism after the civil rights movement was more sociological than scientific. So when white supremacists come along today and resurrect arguments for Darwinian racism from years gone by, modern evolutionary theory may not have the moral resources to persuade them otherwise.”  Regardless of whether he is correct about evolutionary theory lacking the “moral resources” to counter racist claim, in point of fact it does have the scientific resources to do so.  For instance, the killer’s belief that “Whites and Blacks are separated by tens of thousands of years of evolution” is directly contradicted by scientific evidence that shows, for instance, that most recent common ancestor of all human beings now alive &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15457259/&quot;&gt;most likely lived no more than a few thousand years ago.&lt;/a&gt; The idea that the human species is polygenic in it origin is one that &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118584538.ieba0579&quot;&gt;has been refuted for some time now&lt;/a&gt;.   And, in fairness to West, he does acknowledge that “obviously, believing in evolution doesn’t compel one to be a racist, let alone predispose a person  to be a killer. Nevertheless, if we want to counteract the influences that shape people like the Buffalo shooter, we need to face the way evolutionary science is being misused to support the new white supremacists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems like a good idea, so it was disappointing to read &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/05/weikart-in-his-own-mind-white-supremacist-gunman-was-only-following-the-science/&quot;&gt; an article posted only a few days later on Evolution News&lt;/a&gt; by David Klinghoffer, also about the Buffalo mass shooting, in which he discusses the writings of another DI fellow, Richard Weikart.  Klinghoffer states (as best as I can tell without any irony intended) that the killer believed “he was only following the science — the very best evolutionary science.”  You can read the article in vain for any indication that what the killer believed to be “the very best evolutionary science” was in fact a very poor and inaccurate parody of that science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to find how hard the Discovery Institute has tried to correct the misconception, identified by West, that evolutionary theory supports White Supremacism and other forms or racism, I decided to do a search of the EN archives for the term “Hitler”.  And, let me tell you, they talk about Hitler a lot!  I received page after page of hits.  Isn’t that odd?  Why would a website, supposedly devoted to the discussion of evolutionary theory, have so much to say about Hitler?  If you were to look at the index of any textbook on evolution, I highly doubt you would even find a single mention of him.  Many of the most recent articles are by or about the aforementioned Richard Weikart, who seems to have developed something of a cottage industry writing books that blame Darwin for the rise of the Nazis.  In fact, it was through this search that I learned that the ID actually has an entire website devoted to Weikart’s writings, with the catchy title &lt;a href=&quot;https://darwintohitler.com/&quot;&gt;“From Darwin to Hitler”&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s not too difficult to imagine how an angry and confused young man with an arsenal of semiautomatic weapons in his basement might get the idea from this that Darwinism leads to White Supremacism, is it?  And you can search that website in vain for even the slightest indication that such an association would only result from a gross misunderstanding of the facts of evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it goes.  As you read through the many articles the DI has produced on evolution and Hitler, you will repeatedly find remarks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2012/05/more_missing_li/&quot;&gt;this from the DI’s Board Chairman Bruce Chapman&lt;/a&gt;:  “The intellectual lineage is obvious and irrefutable. No Darwin, no eugenics.”  (Which is patent nonsense.  Sufficient theoretical grounding for eugenics could be found in the practice of selective breeding, which has been part of agriculture and animal husbandry since pre-history.)  I won’t claim to have read every single article the DI has written about Hitler and “Darwinism”.  That would be next to impossible.  However, I did look thru a good number of them, and other than that single comment by West mentioned earlier, I found no mention of the fact that any attempt to use evolutionary theory to legitimize racism would require a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be serious about this.  Any attempt to reduce the causes of a specific mass shooting, or of mass shootings in general, to a single factor is bound to be a gross oversimplification.  But it does not appear to me that the DI is even concerned with trying to help efforts to understand, and hopefully prevent, future tragedies.  From the moment of its founding, an explicit objective of the Intelligent Design movement has been promote the idea that acceptance of the idea that humans evolved from earlier species thru natural processes leads to moral depravity.  One might like to believe the Discovery Institute is above exploiting a tragedy like the Buffalo shooting to promote this agenda. But, no.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Faizal Ali</name></author><summary type="html">This article is about the mass shooting that took place at the Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo, New York, on May 14, 2022 in which 10 people lost their lives.

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iupress.org/9781684351794/weird-earth/&quot;&gt;Weird Earth&lt;/a&gt; by Donald Prothero, Red Lightning Press, 2020.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been reading, for example, &lt;i&gt;Skeptical Inquirer&lt;/i&gt; for 40 years or so, you may think you have little to gain from reading this splendid, newish book by the eminent geologist Donald Prothero. You would not be more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iupress.org/9781684351794/weird-earth/&quot;&gt;Weird Earth&lt;/a&gt;, is subtitled “Debunking strange ideas about our planet,” and debunk it does. I thought I knew a lot of the strange ideas about the planet, and indeed I did. But did I know the details? Usually not. Further, I had no idea that the earth is expanding (it is not), that Mount Shasta is riddled with tunnels leading to a secret city (it is not), nor that &lt;i&gt;ley lines&lt;/i&gt; connect various points on a map (they do not).
Professor Prothero devotes 16 chapters to debunking these and other concepts in some detail. Mostly the exposition was clear and I understood it easily; only rarely did I have to grapple with a description or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book actually contains 18 chapters. The first describes “Science and critical thinking.” This chapter briefly discusses how “[s]cience is a way of thinking about the world.” If I had one criticism, it would regard the common claim that scientists actively attempt to disprove, or falsify, their hypotheses. It is not as simple as that, though surely when good scientists find that their hypotheses have been falsified, they will react accordingly. Nevertheless, when Rutherford traveled to the south seas, he did not intend to falsify general relativity. (See my post and comments &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/04/scientific-attitude.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last chapter explains &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; people believe weird things and introduces such concepts as motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, backfire effect, compartmentalism and cognitive dissonance, and even tribalism. Professor Prothero marvels at the existence of “smart idiots,” who “selectively bias what they learn” in order to defend their (weird) beliefs to their followers. Indeed, he argues that “the root of most of our cognitive biases is tribalism,” a claim that, if true, requires a somewhat broad definition of tribalism. He goes back, convincingly, to the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine during the Reagan administration to explain today’s proliferation of nonsense on formerly reputable television channels. Were I writing the book, I might have combined this chapter with the first or made it the second, so that readers would more readily understand why people believed weird things, but maybe that is just a matter of taste.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">Weird Earth by Donald Prothero, Red Lightning Press, 2020.

&lt;p&gt;A team of geologists from West Virginia University has discovered what are apparently living cells in halite (rock salt) estimated to be 830 Ma old and more than 1.5 km below the surface. You may read a summary by Michelle Starr in &lt;i&gt;Science Alert&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/830-million-year-old-microorganisms-found-trapped-in-australian-rock&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or you may find the full article in &lt;i&gt;Geology&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1130/G49957.1&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geologists used optical and ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy and found what they think are algal and prokaryotic cells trapped inside liquid inclusions in the halite. It is at least possible that the cells are alive, judging by the fluorescence spectra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked with a biologist, who confirmed my intuition that a seed or a spore, in order to remain alive, must display at least minimal metabolism. It is therefore hard to imagine a spore lasting for so many years, and indeed the &lt;i&gt;Geology&lt;/i&gt; paper notes that the “microorganisms may survive in fluid inclusions by metabolic changes, including starvation survival and cyst stages, and coexistence with organic compounds or dead cells that could serve as nutrient sources,” that is, that they may have been active sometimes and dormant at other times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, we used some green branches as tomato stakes. At the end of the season, we noticed some green leaves at the top end of one or more of the stakes. “How stubborn life is!” my mother exclaimed. She did not know the half of it.&lt;/p&gt;
