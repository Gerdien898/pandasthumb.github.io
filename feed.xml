&lt;p&gt;On September 4, Ken Ham blogged on speakers/preachers at his upcoming “&lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2022/09/04/hear-from-stephen-kendrick-tony-perkins-dr.-owen-strachan-and-more/&quot;&gt;Answers for Pastors and Leaders&lt;/a&gt;” event at the Ark. Several are far-right extremists and Christian Nationalists, but one in particular takes the cake: Tony Perkins, the President of Family Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony Perkins merits not only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Perkins_(politician)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; but also an &lt;a href=&quot;http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2012/04/316-tony-perkins.html&quot;&gt;entry in The Encyclopedia of American Loons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ham claims he and his ministry, Answers in Genesis, are against racism, in spite of receiving an &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/dinosaur-fossil.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allosaurus&lt;/i&gt; skeleton valued at $1 million from neo-Confederate and former League of the South Board member Michael Peroutka&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 that is on display at the Creation Museum. Perkins makes Peroutka look moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the usual extreme right-wing policies promoted by Perkins, such as attacks on LGBTQ people and their right to marry, he has some astounding racist ties. According to Wikipedia, he has disquieting associations and also paid Klansman David Duke $82,500 for his mailing list while managing a US Senate campaign. See this part of the Wikipedia page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; On May 17, 2001, Perkins gave a speech to the Louisiana chapter of the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white supremacist group that has described black people as a &quot;retrograde species of humanity&quot;. Perkins said he did not know the group's ideology at the time. In an April 26, 2005, article in The Nation, Max Blumenthal reported that while managing the unsuccessful U. S. Senate campaign of Woody Jenkins in 1996, Perkins &quot;paid former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke $82,500 for his mailing list.&quot; Perkins denied knowing about the purchase. A document authorizing the payment was reported to contain Perkins' signature. The incident resurfaced in the local press in 2002, during Perkins' unsuccessful Senate run. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Kentucky media could be persuaded to cover this, as the Ark receives $1.825 million per year as part of a sales tax rebate incentive from Kentucky Tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

It is not clear that the Ulster Museum will end up in court, but the fact is that an unnamed citizen submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for “‘empirical evidence and hard science’ used to support the museum’s ‘endorsement of the origins of the human species,’” according to the Telegraph article. Instead of, as a colleague put it, giving the person a link to the Smithsonian, the Museum evidently elected to ignore the request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Chekhov(L) and Tolstoy(R).  Were they discussing the origin of the book?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article at the Discovery Institute’s
website Evolution News &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/08/from-intelligent-cause-to-intelligent-design-my-debt-to-charles-thaxton/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reprints a tribute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
that Stephen Meyer paid to Charles Thaxton,
in a preface Meyer wrote to a memoir
by Thaxton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During a session on the origin of life, the scientists 
discussed a question I had never considered: 
Where did the information stored in the DNA molecule 
come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On February 10, 1985, I learned I wasn’t the only one. On 
that day I found myself sitting in front of 
eight world-class scientists, who were 
discussing the vexing scientific and 
philosophical question: How did the first life on earth arise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um, different question!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “information stored in the DNA molecule” is of course the precise sequence of bases.  Not the existence of the molecule
in the first place.  And there are well-known evolutionary processes that are capable of putting adaptive information into
the molecule by choosing particular bases at each site.  They continue to happen long after the origin of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very much like someone saying that to explain the information stored in some computer memory, what we have to discuss
is how the computer came to exist.  No, we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we compare a novel by Leo Tolstoy to a set of short stories by Anton Chekhov, what is of interest is not how books
came to be invented, or how the particular binding, fonts, and physical format were chosen.  The two works might be
very much the same in those respects, but they of course will be very different in the sequence of letters in the
books.  And that is where the information is that makes them different, and makes both of them remarkable.  In the
photo above we see Chekhov(L) with Tolstoy(R), when Tolstoy visited Chekhov’s dacha in 1900.  The two authors 
had much to discuss about their writings, and those of others.  But I doubt they spent much of that time discussing 
how and where books first arose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of Meyer’s piece concentrates on the origin of life, and does not at all discuss how the information in the 
DNA got there.  Why does Meyer insist on describing that as the issue? Is there some big mystery?  Are the ordinary processes of evolution, such as natural selection and 
mutation somehow incapable, in principle, of putting into the DNA information that leads to the organism being well-adapted?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in the sequences in DNA (or RNA) genomes can lead to differences in phenotype.  And those differences in 
phenotype can lead to differences in function, and thus differences in fitness.  The sequences with higher fitness will 
tend to increase in frequency.  The genotypes in the population come to be better adapted.  When we use the scale of 
fitness as a specification, the functional information in the genome then increases.  There is no mystery as to how 
this can happen, no proof that improved adaptation is somehow impossible in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misunderstanding-or-misdirection&quot;&gt;Misunderstanding or misdirection?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates of ID and creationists often avoid talking about how changes of DNA sequence by mutation and by changes of 
gene frequency of the resulting DNA sequences increase the functional information in the DNA.  They usually immediately 
change the subject to the Origin Of Life.  I like to call this change of topic OTOOL (Off To the Origin Of Life), or
STOOL (Switch To the Origin Of Life).  It is moving to a much-less-well-understood topic, one where Design Intervention 
can be invoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They often say that they do not question the processes of “microevolution”, including mutation, natural selection, 
gene flow, and genetic drift.  Yet these processes can easily be shown to put functional information into the pool of 
genomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what Stephen Meyer does in the Preface to Thaxton’s book, the one quoted in his piece in Evolution News.  It’s the 
old switcheroo once again.  When Meyer raises the issue of how the information comes to be in the DNA, he immediately does the
old familiar change-of-topic.  If he does not mean to deliberately switch the topic, then he is giving a strong indication 
that he simply does not understand what the functional information in DNA is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-the-echo-chamber&quot;&gt;In the echo chamber&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as usual,
at Uncommon Descent, the Meyer/Thaxton article is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-evolution-news-from-intelligent-cause-to-intelligent-design-my-debt-to-charles-thaxton/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taken very seriously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and quoted at length, with no
recognition that the origin of the information in
the DNA might be a different issue from the origin of the first DNA molecule.  The post is authored by “Caspian”, who the
site identifies as its regular poster, physicist Eric Hedin.  He ought to have a good grasp of
information theory.  Is it too much 
to ask whether the site might someday distinguish between these two questions?  Apparently so.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Chekhov(L) and Tolstoy(R). Were they discussing the origin of the book?

On that day I found myself sitting in front of eight world-class scientists, who were discussing the vexing scientific and philosophical question: How did the first life on earth arise? Um, different question! The “information stored in the DNA molecule” is of course the precise sequence of bases. Not the existence of the molecule in the first place. And there are well-known evolutionary processes that are capable of putting adaptive information into the molecule by choosing particular bases at each site. They continue to happen long after the origin of life. Let me explain:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Myers, Phelps dissect creationist video</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/08/myers-phelps-dissect.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Myers, Phelps dissect creationist video" /><published>2022-08-14T09:33:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-08-14T09:33:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/08/myers-phelps-dissect</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/08/myers-phelps-dissect.html">&lt;p&gt;I am right now watching an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU3SgSc4j38&quot;&gt;unnamed video&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZ_Myers&quot;&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncse.ngo/friend-darwin-daniel-j-phelps&quot;&gt;Dan Phelps&lt;/a&gt; dissect a creationist video by Answers in Genesis functionary &lt;a href=&quot;https://answersingenesis.org/bios/tim-chaffey/&quot;&gt;Tim Chaffey&lt;/a&gt;. The format is essentially that Prof. Myers plays a bit of the Chaffey video, then pauses and – I was going to say they dissect it, but demolish may be the better word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original video is rather odd: it appears to have been speeded up, and all the pauses have been eliminated. It is as if they want to get through their arguments so fast that you cannot understand or refute them. (See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop&quot;&gt;Gish gallop&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not finished watching the video yet, but one thing that caught my attention was this: Mr. Chaffey is at pains to demonstrate that the Ark was big enough to hold all the “kinds” necessary. Apart from his risible contention that sea creatures needed no saving from a flood that could carve the Grand Canyon, Mr. Chaffey seems to think that the Ark had enough space to house the necessary land creatures. In rebuttal, Prof. Myers cleverly looked up the land areas and numbers of species of several zoos, not to mention the number of employees. Suffice to say that the zoos occupied more area than the Ark and had more employees than Noah and his family. (Yes, I know, the zoos need room for visitors. Fine, cut the area and the number of employees by 5 and compare that to the Ark.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will watch the rest of the video later on, but please feel free to comment, and do not worry about spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt Young</name></author><summary type="html">I am right now watching an unnamed video in which PZ Myers and Dan Phelps dissect a creationist video by Answers in Genesis functionary Tim Chaffey.

They tout a new addition to their collection, a giant palm frond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Meanwhile, the Ark Encounter continues to make major additions. On the third deck of the massive ship [sic], a large exhibit highlighting a giant plant fossil is now on display. This unique 10’7” palm frond fossil was discovered in the well-known Green River Formation of Wyoming. &lt;/p&gt;  
 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. Andrew Snelling, head of the research department at AiG, declared: 'It is a phenomenal, world-class fossil. It is not millions of years old. The palm frond was buried catastrophically as a result of the global flood of Noah’s day about 4,500 years ago.' A family in Wisconsin made the fossil’s donation possible.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The palm frond, we note, is in very good condition for something that was buried catastrophically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Green River Shale fossils are actually common and well-studied, so this display isn’t hurting scientific research as badly as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/06/will-aig-return.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allosaurus&lt;/i&gt; specimen they received from the neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka&lt;/a&gt;.  Magnificent specimens like these are very expensive. This one was probably prepared by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenriverstone.com/&quot;&gt;Green River Stone Company&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial excavator and preparation company that is concerned exclusively with making sales (one of many problems with the commercial fossil market; sales do not necessarily benefit scientific research).  Ham’s Wisconsin donors must have deep pockets. I hope the donors and the costs are revealed on a future AiG or Crosswater Canyon IRS Form 990. I will be looking.&lt;/p&gt;
