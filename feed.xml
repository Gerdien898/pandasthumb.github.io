They tout a new addition to their collection, a giant palm frond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Meanwhile, the Ark Encounter continues to make major additions. On the third deck of the massive ship [sic], a large exhibit highlighting a giant plant fossil is now on display. This unique 10’7” palm frond fossil was discovered in the well-known Green River Formation of Wyoming. &lt;/p&gt;  
 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. Andrew Snelling, head of the research department at AiG, declared: 'It is a phenomenal, world-class fossil. It is not millions of years old. The palm frond was buried catastrophically as a result of the global flood of Noah’s day about 4,500 years ago.' A family in Wisconsin made the fossil’s donation possible.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The palm frond, we note, is in very good condition for something that was buried catastrophically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Green River Shale fossils are actually common and well-studied, so this display isn’t hurting scientific research as badly as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/06/will-aig-return.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Allosaurus&lt;/i&gt; specimen they received from the neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka&lt;/a&gt;.  Magnificent specimens like these are very expensive. This one was probably prepared by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greenriverstone.com/&quot;&gt;Green River Stone Company&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial excavator and preparation company that is concerned exclusively with making sales (one of many problems with the commercial fossil market; sales do not necessarily benefit scientific research).  Ham’s Wisconsin donors must have deep pockets. I hope the donors and the costs are revealed on a future AiG or Crosswater Canyon IRS Form 990. I will be looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous post, I argued that modern-day critics of the Modern Evolutionary 
Synthesis who think that they are putting forth a Lamarckian theory most likely
aren’t doing that, as they do not actually believe that the direction of change 
toward adaptation comes from use and disuse of organs.  To Lamarck, the 
directionality was not due to external environmental effects being inherited, 
it was actually the effort made by the individual to use particular organs more or use them 
less that somehow altered its genetic makeup and it was those changes that were inherited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now comes Dennis Noble.  A leader of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis 
group and one of the main organizers of the notorious 2016 meeting on New Trends 
in Evolutionary Biology brought about by misguided biologists, philosophers, and
historians who talked the Royal Society into endorsing it, he has published 
another outburst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noble, an eminent physiologist, points to exosome vesicles that can cross the 
barrier between the somatic cells and the germ cells in animals, ones that can
contain mRNA.  These, he argues, can serve as the basis for the effects of use 
and disuse to alter the herditary material.  He does not actually show that this 
is what they do.  A critical issue is whether the effects on the somatic cells 
then induce in the germ cells a genetic change that is adaptive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t listen to me.  Jerry Coyne has lost his temper and published a 
critique at his blog &lt;em&gt;Why Evolution Is True&lt;/em&gt;. He tears strips off Noble in a rather 
disrespectful way.  Which seems to me to be appropriate.  When Jerry gets into 
a high Evolutionary Synthesis dudgeon, he is well worth reading.  You will

On this day, August 1, in 1744 Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de Lamarck, was born.  Had he lived he would now be a sprightly 
278 years old.  It is time for my annual birthday post.  He was the first evolutionary biologist.  In addition to world-class work in invertebrate taxonomy he argued for common descent and put forward a mechanism to account for adaptation.  No not inheritance of acquired characters – everyone always knew that it was true.  The mechanism was Use and Disuse. Organisms tried to solve their problems by using (or disusing) their organs, and the resulting changes would be adaptive and of course would be passed on to the next generation.  Lamarck also believed that,
in addition, there was an overall force in descent of organisms in nature leading to an increase of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Lamarckism dead now?  Well, yes and no.  Let me explain …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are people who have evolutionary theories that they think are Lamarckian.  A prime example is Dr. Eva Jablonka, an evolutionary biologist at the Cohn Institute for the History of Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University. 
She declares herself a Lamarckian, invoking epigenetic changes of DNA as her mechanism (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Jablonka&quot;&gt;her Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does that mean she believes that, in addition to the known physical laws, that there is an inherent complexifying force in nature?  I don’t think so.  And does she believe that use and disuse of organs, together with epigenetic inheritance, explains adaptations?  I can’t see that she does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She does identify her views as Lamarckian in her web page at the Third Way of Evolution website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thethirdwayofevolution.com/people/view/eva-jablonka&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  She is also a member of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis group (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://extendedevolutionarysynthesis.com/person/eva-jablonka/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  She has written many books, and you can easily find YouTube videos of lectures where she advocates views she calls Lamarckian. For a critical review of her arguments, see Bruce Walsh’s book review in volume 50, number 5, 1996 in &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03600.x&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside her main concerns, which are to vindicate the importance of epigenetic phenomena in evolution, and to place them in the context of other forms of non-Mendelian inheritance, we can ask whether Lamarck would recognize her views as his own.  I can’t see that he would.  “Lamarckian” evolutionary phenomena may be repeatedly invoked by a generation of skeptics of the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis.  But in their view evolutionary changes that involve epigenetic variations in populations come from natural selection acting on those variations.  By contrast, use and disuse is different: a kind of directed mutation.  Lamarck’s theory invoked, in effect, directed mutation, and did not depend on selecting among variations in the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lamarck is being invoked against the Modern Synthesis.  But his theories of change are not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">Happy birthday, Jean-Baptiste!

&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
A hoatzin in Peru (Kate from UK, CC BY-SA 2.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0&quot;&gt;via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/div&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismissals of evolutionary biology have come at such a pace lately that we need at least a monthly report on how the previous month’s evolutionary theory has been overthrown. I hope that this can 
be a regular feature.  I figure that once a month is about 
right, as there are enough overthrows of evolutionary theory to
supply it.  Well, actually I hope that there will be no
need for such a series, but alas …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month we report on two such events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hoatzin, a silly-looking bird that looks like a confused
chicken, is hard to place on the phylogeny of birds.  An 
article in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; suggests that this may discredit
the very notion of a phylogeny.  That in turn has led to comments
by many of the usual suspects.  One of the major scientific papers on
bird phylogeny has as an author our own John Harshman.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A survey of new discoveries in evolutionary biology appeared
in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.  Its author called for existing
evolutionary theory to be tossed out and for it to be replaced
by the thinking of the supporters of the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis.  The piece has been welcomed by creationists and
advocates of ID, and criticized by pro-evolution websites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Below the fold” you will find some more details and links.  Will
the new paradigms still be around a month from now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hoatzin-disproves-the-tree&quot;&gt;The hoatzin disproves the tree&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hoatzin, which looks like an exasperated chicken, seems to
have diverged from other birds early in the radiation of modern
birds.  The branches in the tree of life connecting it to their
ancestors are short, and long ago.  That is the situation in which 
we expect it to be difficult to place the hoatzin branch. But an
article in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; by Ben Crair
on July 15, 2022 comes
to a much more dramatic conclusion 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-bizarre-bird-thats-breaking-the-tree-of-life&quot;&gt;(you can find it here, perhaps behind a paywall)&lt;/a&gt;.
The hoatzin “is breaking the
tree of life”.  He mentions a number of phenomena, such as
discrepancies between “gene trees” (coalescents) and species
trees, as reasons that the genealogy of the hoatzin calls
into question the notion of phylogeny:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Darwin thought family trees could explain evolution. The hoatzin suggets otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crair’s dramatic piece has been noticed and commented on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jerry Coyne, at his site Why Evolution Is True &lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/07/17/the-new-yorker-writes-about-the-hoatzin-implies-that-darwns-idea-of-evolutionary-trees-may-be-a-phantom/&quot;&gt;is upset at the New Yorker article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Discovery Institute’s “Evolution News” reporter David Klinghoffer &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/bizarre-bird-highlights-the-problem-of-biogeography/&quot;&gt;reacts to Jerry’s article&lt;/a&gt;.  It is less clear
whether Klinghoffer would accept any genealogical scheme for the
relationships of living organisms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Here, in the previous thread on the photo of
the Greater Yellowlegs &lt;em&gt;Tringa melanoleuca&lt;/em&gt; there was
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/tringa-melanoleuca.html&quot;&gt;some discussion of the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; 
in the comments, after the troll “Data” linked to it there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;goodbye-to-the-evolutionary-synthesis-too&quot;&gt;Goodbye to the evolutionary synthesis too&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the hoatzin piece were not enough, the past month also saw
a piece in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; casually toss out the Modern
Synthesis.  Stephen Buranyi wrote
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jun/28/do-we-need-a-new-theory-of-evolution&quot;&gt;a deliberately provocate “long read” article&lt;/a&gt;
entitled “Do we need a new theory of evolution?”  His 
subheading text is more provocative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A new wave of scientists argues that mainstream evolutionary theory needs an urgent overhaul. Their opponents have dismissed them as misguided careerists – and the conflict may determine the future of biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the article promotes the views that their advocates have
labelled the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.  The EES was first
put forward by a group who have been called The Altenberg 16, who
met in 2008 in a meeting in Altenberg, Austria.  The meeting was
greeted with great joy by the Discovery Institute, and journalist 
Susan Mazur wrote a whole book about it: &lt;em&gt;The Altenberg 16: An
exposé of the evolution industry&lt;/em&gt;, which she published
&lt;em&gt;before the meeting had taken place&lt;/em&gt;.  It was followed in 2016
by a meeting on &lt;em&gt;New trends in evolutionary biology: biological,
philosophical, and social science perspectives&lt;/em&gt; sponsored by the Royal Society,
and involving some of the same people (though many of the
evolutionary biologists in the Royal Society were unhappy
about its endorsement of these views).  There has been much blog
traffic about these meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buranyi discusses many of the phenomena invoked by the
EES.  It is obvious that his suggested answer is “yes”,
in violation of Betteridge’s Law of Headlines.  There have
been many reactions to Buranyi’s article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolutionary biologists Brian Charlesworth, Deborah Charlesworth
and Jerry Coyne &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jul/05/evolutionary-biologists-are-ever-adapting-to-progress-in-science&quot;&gt;wrote a reply in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; expressing
their disagreement wth the article, concluding that it
“gives a misleading picture of contemporary evolutonary.
biology”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/07/06/our-rejected-letters-to-the-guardian-about-evolution/&quot;&gt;At his site Why Evolution Is True&lt;/a&gt;, Jerry Coyne
republished their article, also a letter by
evolutionary biologist Doug Futuyma that the Guardian
declined to publish, as well as a list of errors in
Buranyi’s article that Brian Charlesworth compiled.  In
addition he describes three other replies that the
Guardian did publish, which he is not impressed by.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At Larry Moran’s important blog Sandwalk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2022/07/do-we-need-new-theory-of-evolution.html&quot;&gt;he
posted on the Guardian article&lt;/a&gt;. His
view is that the current theory should be called Modern Evolutionary
Biology, and he is not happy with the EES folks.  He says
that Buranyi’s article is pretty good, if you ignore
its “unfortunate” first four paragraphs, which he quotes.
Some Panda’s Thumb regulars are among the commenters on Larry’s
article.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;P. Z. Myers discussed the Buranyi article at some length
&lt;a href=&quot;https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2022/06/28/not-impressed-by-the-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/&quot;&gt;at his blog, Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; in a post
entitled “Not impressed by the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis”.  He
and Jerry Coyne are in more agreement on that than either would
like to admit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Of course, Evolution News needed to have its say,
which it did more than once, in articles &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/donate-darwinism-for-a-tax-credit-evolutionists-admit-their-fields-failures/&quot;&gt;by David Klinghoffer&lt;/a&gt;
(“evolutionists admit their field’s failures …. full of scandalous admissions”),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;… and &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/darwin-and-the-ghost-of-lamarck/&quot;&gt;a mention&lt;/a&gt; in an article by philology, lterature, and
philosophy professor Neil Thomas about Darwin and Lamarck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have previously posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/uncommon-diversion.html&quot;&gt;here at PT&lt;/a&gt; on Uncommon
Descent’s invocation of Buranyi’s article when looking
forward to pro-ID rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cue creationist David Coppedge &lt;a href=&quot;https://crev.info/2022/07/darwin-sausage-factory-exposed/&quot;&gt;at Creation/Evolution Headlines&lt;/a&gt;.  The title, “Darwin Sausage Factory Exposed” and the summary “A look inside the sausage factory where Darwinism

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my obviously-biased view, evolutionary biology has
already assimilated many of these phenomena, so that the
discussion is really just about whether or not to rename
the theory.  Renaming has the disadvantage that it may lead
most people to assume that the evolutionary processes that
they learned about in school, including mutation, natural
selection, genetic drift, and gene flow, have been discarded.
(The EES folks would say that the phenomena that they invoke
are not being paid enough attention, and so a renaming is
needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We await with eagerness next month’s new paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joe Felsenstein</name></author><summary type="html">A hoatzin in Peru (Kate from UK, CC BY-SA 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons) &amp;nbsp; Dismissals of evolutionary biology have come at such a pace lately that we need at least a monthly report on how the previous month’s evolutionary theory has been overthrown. I hope that this can be a regular feature. I figure that once a month is about right, as there are enough overthrows of evolutionary theory to supply it. Well, actually I hope that there will be no need for such a series, but alas … This month we report on two such events: The hoatzin, a silly-looking bird that looks like a confused chicken, is hard to place on the phylogeny of birds. An article in The New Yorker suggests that this may discredit the very notion of a phylogeny. That in turn has led to comments by many of the usual suspects. One of the major scientific papers on bird phylogeny has as an author our own John Harshman. A survey of new discoveries in evolutionary biology appeared in The Guardian. Its author called for existing evolutionary theory to be tossed out and for it to be replaced by the thinking of the supporters of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis. The piece has been welcomed by creationists and advocates of ID, and criticized by pro-evolution websites. “Below the fold” you will find some more details and links. Will the new paradigms still be around a month from now?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tringa melanoleuca</title><link href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/tringa-melanoleuca.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tringa melanoleuca" /><published>2022-07-18T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-07-18T11:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/tringa-melanoleuca</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/tringa-melanoleuca.html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that, as of Wednesday (July 13) late afternoon, that Answers 
in Genesis has posted nothing about the spectacular preliminary results from the James Webb 
Space Telescope (JWST) released the previous day. Most people probably missed it, but AiG 
has responded in a very poor way, on their Facebook and possibly other social media. On 
Tuesday, July 12 on AiG’s and Ken Ham’s Facebook pages, there was a simulcast of the NASA 
press conference where the first photos and results from the JWST were shown. Here is the link to the Ham Facebook post of the simulcast video: 
﻿&lt;a href=&quot;https://fb.watch/ee25qVAHqq/?mibextid=qZdngE&amp;amp;fs=e&amp;amp;s=cl&quot;&gt;https://fb.watch/ee25qVAHqq/?mibextid=qZdngE&amp;amp;fs=e&amp;amp;s=cl&lt;/a&gt;.
I don’t know if you have to have a Facebook account to view this.  (It is also available on Youtube
&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/od6829WF-S4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their response was by AiG’s astronomer, Dr. Danny Faulkner, and their “rocket scientist,” Rob 
Webb. Their discussion was a rather weak critique of the JWST’s findings and funny and sad at the same 
time. Through most of their simulcast, one couldn’t hear what the NASA people were saying, but this 
may have been a technical difficulty. About 23 minutes in Dr. Faulkner and Webb bizarrely claim that 
light year distances don’t necessarily equal long time scales (thus not refuting a 6,000 year old 
universe). Soon after, Dr. Faulkner states his “theory” (not a scientific theory, but he doesn’t seem 
to know this) that we can see things billions of light years away in a 6,000 year old universe because 
of a “miracle.” His position is literally “then a miracle occurred.” This is reminiscent of the famous 
Sidney Harris cartoon found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencecartoonsplus.com/pages/gallery.php&quot;&gt;here:&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Faulkner 
goes on to say that Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden saw pretty much what we see today when 
looking at the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the rest of the simulcast consisted of preaching, and mocking NASA by ascribing the scientific 
views of NASA (and basically all of science) as “naturalistic worldview” and “assumptions” while 
touting their un-scientific use of “Biblical glasses.” At one point Dr. Faulkner would sip a drink of 
Cheerwine cherry cola every time he thought “naturalistic assumptions” were mentioned by 
NASA. Interestingly, Faulkner is skeptical that stars are forming today in spite of an incredible 
amount of information that has been around for decades,  plus the spectacular visual of the Eta Carina 
Nebulae just provided by the JWST. Perhaps his standard of evidence is considerably different from 
mainstream astronomers. One suspects no amount of evidence could change their views. After all, 
both Dr. Faulkner and Webb have signed AiG’s “Statement of Faith” found 
here ( https://answersingenesis.org/about/faith/). One clause even posits, as a requirement for AiG employment, that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No apparent, perceived, or claimed evidence in any field of study, including science, history, and chronology, can be valid if it contradicts the clear teaching of Scripture obtained by historical-grammatical interpretation. Of primary importance is the fact that evidence is always subject to interpretation by fallible people who do not possess all information (Numbers 23:19; 2 Samuel 22:31; Psalm 18:30; Isaiah 46:9–10, 55:9; Romans 3:4; 2 Timothy 3:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Faulkner advertised one of his books available from AiG near the end of the broadcast. Then AiG’s 
simulcast ended with more preaching by Faulkner and Webb, imploring us to not trust 
the “shifting sands of Man’s opinions” and reminding us that AiG, the Ark, and Creation Museum 
are “all about the Gospel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe I sat through the entire simulcast. I want that time back!  As mentioned, it was 
unintentionally funny and sad, but still an enormous waste of time. The creationist’s bizarre views 
are ignored by science, but are held by millions of voters. I wouldn’t have endured this, but AiG and 
its followers have an inordinate influence on science education in Kentucky and elsewhere and 
the Ark is still receiving a $1.825 million per year sales tax incentive rebate from Kentucky 
Tourism. AiG has support from numerous Kentucky politicians and counts two candidates for 
Governor (Attorney General Daniel Cameron and State Representative Savannah Maddox), and perhaps 
more, as supporters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Dan Phelps</name></author><summary type="html">NASA SMACS0732 image from JWST space telescope. Public domain.

UPDATE: July 8, 2022.  David Klinghoffer has now &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/rosenhouse-roundup/&quot;&gt;posted a link&lt;/a&gt; to my reply to William Dembski's review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Failures-Mathematical-Anti-Evolutionism-Jason-Rosenhouse/dp/1108820441/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26C2DNOQ4ZV60&amp;amp;keywords=rosenhouse&amp;amp;qid=1657328451&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=%2Cstripbooks%2C89&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt;.  He even encourages people to buy the book.  Thanks!   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On July 5, at 4:09 pm, Eastern time, I received the following email from the Discovery Institute's David Klinghoffer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dear Jason,

Your new book caught the attention of my Discovery Institute colleague Bill Dembski. We have been publishing his review of it serially at Evolution News, which I edit. Now that that’s done, as your time permits, I wanted to cordially invite you to respond to his review in the same forum, at whatever length you think is appropriate, without editorial interference. Since Dembski’s work is covered and critiqued extensively in your book, as he notes, I hope you will accept the offer, while giving me a reply to the invitation that I can share with our readers, whom I’ve alerted about this prospect for dialogue.

I look forward to hearing from you.

David
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Normally I would not publish a private email without the sender's permission, but in this case I think it's OK to do so.  You see, Klinghoffer was so pleased with this email that he posted it himself at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/invitation-to-jason-rosenhouse-respond-to-dembski/&quot;&gt;Discovery Institute's blog.&lt;/a&gt;  The title of the post was: Invitation to Jason Rosenhouse: Respond to Dembski.  He concluded the post with, &quot;Now let's find out what he will say.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At 4:17 pm, just eight minutes later, I sent the following reply to Klinghoffer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hi David.  Thank you for the invitation.  I have recently posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/Dembski-response.html&quot;&gt;a reply to Dembski&lt;/a&gt; at the Panda's Thumb.  I intend for that to be my last word on the subject.
  
Jason
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I write this, close to two days have passed, but Klinghoffer has not updated his original post to let his readers know that I had replied to Dembski.  Nor did he post something new indicating that I had done so.  One minute he's looking forward to hearing from me and musing about the prospects for dialogue, but the next it's crickets.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It's almost as if he didn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to have an exchange of ideas, but was instead just preening for his readers. He now knows &quot;what he will say&quot;, but seems afraid to let his readers in on it.  Why do you suppose that is?
