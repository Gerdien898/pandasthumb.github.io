<figcaption>Unidentified black ant. Mr. Denelsbeck writes, "My subject barely let me get a sharp image, much less anything with key characteristics, so it will remain unidentified for now. In a heated dispute among two black ants, one seized the other's antenna but lost the encounter; the victor apparently sliced off everything it could reach, and was going about its business when I spotted it, carrying around the remains of its opponent dangling from one antenna. At one point it did indeed stop and try to dislodge the dead weight, without success."
