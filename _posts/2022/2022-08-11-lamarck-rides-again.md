In the previous post, I argued that modern-day critics of the Modern Evolutionary 
Synthesis who think that they are putting forth a Lamarckian theory most likely
aren't doing that, as they do not actually believe that the direction of change 
toward adaptation comes from use and disuse of organs.  To Lamarck, the 
directionality was not due to external environmental effects being inherited, 
it was actually the efforts of the individual that altered its genetic makeup 
and it was those that were inherited.

And now comes Dennis Noble.  A leader of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis 
group and one of the main organizers of the notorious 2016 meeting on New Directions 
in Evolutionary Biology brought about by misguided biologists, philosophers, and
historians who talked the Royal Society into endorsing it, he has published 
another outburst.

Noble, an eminent physiologist, points to certain vesicles that can cross the 
barrier between the somatic cells and the germ cells in animals.  These, he argues, 
can serve as the basis for the effects of use and disuse to alter the herditary 
material.  He does not actually show that this is actually what they do.  A 
critical issue is whether the effects on the somatic cells induce a genetic change 
that is adaptive.

But don't listen to me.  Jerry Coyne has lost his temper and published a 
critique at his blog _Why Evolution Is True_. He tears strips off Noble in a rather 
disrespectful way.  Which seems to me to be appropriate.  When Jerry gets into 
a high Evolutionary Synthesis dudgeon, he is well worth reading.  You will 
find his piece [##here##](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/08/07/denis-noble-goes-after-darwinian-evolution-again-scores-own-goal/).  Noble's original cri de couer was published in 
[##here##](https://iai.tv/articles/denis-noble-the-broken-paradigm-of-neo-darwinism-auid-2210).
