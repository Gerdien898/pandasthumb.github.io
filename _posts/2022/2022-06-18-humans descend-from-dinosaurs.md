On June 13, I received an invitation to publish in what was obviously a predatory paleontology journal. The “Assistant Managing Editor” falsely assumed I have a Doctorate (I don’t).

Here is the email, preceded by my curt response:

On June 14,  the “Assistant Managing Editor” made this reply:

I clicked on the link and found, sadly, several papers by people that were probably starting their careers. Then there were a couple of absolute crackpot papers. One featured a <a href="https://medwinpublishers.com/IJPBP/the-saint-loup-of-the-col-du-fam-a-smilodon-caught-in-a-lava-bubble.pdf">weird claim</a> about a supposed saber-tooth cat fossil, that was  comically just weathered rocks (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">pareidolia</a>, no actual bones), but the topper was this “<a href="https://medwinpublishers.com/IJPBP/Proving-that-Dinosaurs-are-Distant-Ancestors-of-Humans–The-East-Asian-Locus-of-Evolution-that-disproves-definitively-the-Out-of-Africa-Theory.pdf">Research Article</a>” that claims humans are the descendants of dinosaurs!
Here is a screenshot of the start of the “Research Article” in case it is removed:

This “science journal” is taking money from naive and delusional people. They should be ashamed. The “<a href="https://medwinpublishers.com/IJPBP/editorial-board.php">Editorial Board</a>” should be forced to help the unfortunate authors who publish with them and should be publicly exposed and shamed for being associated with this “paleontology journal.” 

My apologies for so many scare quotes in this post.
