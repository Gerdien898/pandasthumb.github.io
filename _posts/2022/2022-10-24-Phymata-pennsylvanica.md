<figcaption><a href="https://www.insectidentification.org/insect-description.asp?identification=Ambush-Bug"><i>Phymata pennsylvanica</i></a> &ndash; ambush bugs. The photographer writes, "Ambush bugs are well camouflaged insects that lie in wait on flowers. A visiting insect will be grabbed, and the proboscis of this insect will be used to kill and feed upon the prey. In this case, the female of the mating pair has taken a digger bee (<i>Anthophora</i> sp.). Clearly, ambush bugs are not concerned about taking stinging insects!
