An article at the Discovery Institute's
website Evolution News [__reprints a tribute__](
that Stephen Meyer paid to Charles Thaxton,
in a preface Meyer wrote to a memoir
by Thaxton.


At Uncommon Descent, as usual, the Meyer/Thaxton article is
[__taken very seriously__](https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-evolution-news-from-intelligent-cause-to-intelligent-design-my-debt-to-charles-thaxton/), and quoted at length, with no
recognition that the origin of the information in
the DNA might be a different issue from
the origin of life.

> During a session on the origin of life, the scientists 
> discussed a question I had never considered: 
> Where did the information stored in the DNA molecule 
> come from? 

> On February 10, 1985, I learned I wasnâ€™t the only one. On 
> that day I found myself sitting in front of 
> eight world-class scientists, who were 
> discussing the vexing scientific and 
> philosophical question: How did the first life on earth arise? 

Um, different question!
