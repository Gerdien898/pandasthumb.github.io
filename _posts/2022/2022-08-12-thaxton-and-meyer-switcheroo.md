An article at the Discovery Institute's
website Evolution News [__reprints a tribute__](
that Stephen Meyer paid to Charles Thaxton,
in a preface Meyer wrote to a memoir
by Thaxton.


At Uncommon Descent, as usual, the Meyer/Thaxton article is
[__taken very seriously__](https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-evolution-news-from-intelligent-cause-to-intelligent-design-my-debt-to-charles-thaxton/), and quoted at length, with no
recognition that the origin of the information in
the DNA might be a different issue from
the origin of life.
