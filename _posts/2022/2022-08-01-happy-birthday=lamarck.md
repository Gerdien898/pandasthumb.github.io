Happy birthday, Jean-Baptiste!  On this day, August 1, in 1744 Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet was born.  Had he lived he would now be a sprightly 
278 years old.  He was the first evolutionary biologist.  In addition to world-class work in invertebrate taxonomy he argued for common descent and 
put forward a mechanism to account for adaptation.  No not inheritance of acquired characters -- everyone always knew that was always known to 
be true.  The mechanism was Use and Disuse.
