I was forwarded a press release from Answers in Genesis the other day. They tout a new addition to their collection, a giant palm frond:

<blockquote><p>"Meanwhile, the Ark Encounter continues to make major additions. On the third deck of the massive ship [sic], a large exhibit highlighting a giant plant fossil is now on display. This unique 10’7” palm frond fossil was discovered in the well-known Green River Formation of Wyoming. </p>  
 
<p>"Dr. Andrew Snelling, head of the research department at AiG, declared: 'It is a phenomenal, world-class fossil. It is not millions of years old. The palm frond was buried catastrophically as a result of the global flood of Noah’s day about 4,500 years ago.' A family in Wisconsin made the fossil’s donation possible." </p> </blockquote>

The palm frond, we note, is in very good condition for something that was buried catastrophically.

Fortunately, Green River Shale fossils are actually common and well-studied, so this display isn’t hurting scientific research as badly as the <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/06/will-aig-return.html"><i>Allosaurus</i> specimen they received from the neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka</a>.  Magnificent specimens like these are very expensive. This one was probably prepared by the <a href="https://www.greenriverstone.com/">Green River Stone Company</a>, a commercial excavator and preparation company that is concerned exclusively with making sales (one of many problems with the commercial fossil market; sales do not necessarily benefit scientific research).  Ham’s Wisconsin donors must have deep pockets. I hope the donors and the costs are revealed on a future AiG or Crosswater Canyon IRS Form 990. I will be looking.
