If you look at Ken Ham’s daily Twitter posts like I do, you will see that beyond his usual anti-science spiel and promotion of his “Museum” and Ark Park, he is obsessed with complaining about Disney while simultaneously comparing his inane tourist sites to Disney. He also makes lots of posts about LGBTQ issues, especially those concerning transsexuals. Transsexuals are one of Ken’s big bugaboos and his posts indicate he thinks about them often. In any case, a Facebook post by Ken (below the fold) may indicate he is in trouble on Twitter (especially in France and Germany).

Note that his account says he and Answers in Genesis are on various right-wing sites including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler">Parler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeWe">MeWe</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettr">Gettr</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)">Gab</a>. Considering Ham and AiG’s claims to be anti-racist, one of the few things praiseworthy about him and his AiG ministry, this association with these right-wing social media is remarkable. Each of these sites caters to vile, extremist hate groups that have limited access to other social media. Facebook has reprehensible content, but at least Facebook claims to attempt to keep the worst off. Twitter is almost as bad, but seems slightly more responsible in removing the worst posts, at least for the time being. These other sites are replete with racism, Q’Anon, anti-Semitism, anti-vaxx, and numerous other dumbfery. See the Wikipedia links above for further information about these far-right social media organizations Ham and AiG participate in.

Three tweets below the fold; it appears that Germany did not find the tweet actionable.
