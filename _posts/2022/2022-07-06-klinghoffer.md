Dear Jason,

Your new book caught the attention of my Discovery Institute colleague Bill Dembski. We have been publishing his review of it serially at Evolution News, which I edit. Now that that’s done, as your time permits, I wanted to cordially invite you to respond to his review in the same forum, at whatever length you think is appropriate, without editorial interference. Since Dembski’s work is covered and critiqued extensively in your book, as he notes, I hope you will accept the offer, while giving me a reply to the invitation that I can share with our readers, whom I’ve alerted about this prospect for dialogue.

I look forward to hearing from you.

David

Normally I would not publish a private a email without the sender's permission, but in this case I think it's OK to do so.  You see, Klinghoffer was so pleased with this email that he posted it himself at the <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/invitation-to-jason-rosenhouse-respond-to-dembski/">Discovery Institute's blog.</a>  The title of the post was: Invitation to Jason Rosenhouse: Respond to Dembski.
