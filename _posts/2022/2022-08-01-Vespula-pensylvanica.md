<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespula_pensylvanica"><i>Vespula pensylvanica</i></a> &ndash; western yelowjacket, Boulder, Colorado, May, 2022. This creature entered the house and was very kindly walking on a glass window when I snapped this picture. Mark Sturtevant tells me, "There are statements that if it has isolated black spots on the abdomen, like this one does, then it's a queen. Queens commonly turn up in houses early in the season or late in the season as they wind up in there when seeking shelter to overwinter."
