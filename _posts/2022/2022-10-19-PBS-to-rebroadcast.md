<i>Daniel Phelps was featured in the full-length documentary film </i>We Believe in Dinosaurs<i>, which we reported on <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/04/reviews-of-documentary.html">here</a>. The film was later slightly shortened to accommodate a 1-hour television program; that version was <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/11/we-believe-on-PBS.html">broadcast February 17, 2020</a>. Below is what we received from Mr. Phelps.</i>

I was recently forwarded the message below from ITVS Avis, the producer of the documentary. It looks as if PBS will again air the documentary “We Believe in Dinosaurs” on the PBS show “Independent Lens” on December 19 and make the show available for free streaming until mid-January.

This is wonderful news. The documentary deserved more local and national coverage than it received when it first aired right before the CoVid pandemic hit in 2020. I hope recipients of this message will publicize the film and review it in appropriate publications.

Here is an edited version of the message:
