Our colleague Daniel Phelps reminds us, 

<p>"Last year, I won the Paleontological Society’s <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/07/daniel-phelps-paleontological-society-award.html">Strimple Award</a> [which recognizes outstanding achievement in paleontology by someone who does not make a living full-time from paleontology]. The Journal of Paleontology just published <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2022.63">Colin Sumrall’s presentation</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jpa.2022.64">my acceptance</a> as open access papers. Someone let Ken Ham know."</p>

Because we reported the award over a year ago, we decided to post the texts as a separate item.
