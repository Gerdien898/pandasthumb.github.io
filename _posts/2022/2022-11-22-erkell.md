# Breakthrough for Intelligent Design? (Part 1) #

**Where are the results?**

That articles openly arguing for Intelligent Design (ID) are published in the established scientific press is not something one expects. Therefore, it is worth noting that Ola Hössjer, Professor of Mathematical Statistics at Stockholm University, and Steinar Thorvaldsen, professor of Informatics at Norway's Arctic University in Tromsø, published a work this summer entitled "Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning of molecular machines and systems" in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. On July 8, the Christian newspaper Världen Idag had a report about the publication under the heading "Breakthrough: Research points to intelligent design". The creationist association Genesis writes that Norwegian-Swedish research points to intelligent design in our cells. Now is this a scientific breakthrough for ID?

Perhaps not the breakthrough one had hoped for. When the article was printed in the September issue, there was a "disclaimer" on the website, a disclaimer from the magazine's editors-in-chief. They completely distance themselves from the concept of intelligent design and claim that they were misled by the fact that the authors did not include the keyword "intelligent design" during the review, but added it later.

There's a lot to say about this business, so much so that I'm devoting seven posts to it.

The concept of fine-tuning is one of the more common arguments for ID. It is argued that the natural constants that determine the properties of matter and the universe could have been radically different, and that the probability of a universe with properties that allow intelligent life is vanishingly small. Nevertheless, we are here, and it cannot be a coincidence. It shows design – a cosmic mind has created a universe that suits us. That's the argument in a nutshell.

The purpose of the work is to now go one step further and to show that fine-tuning also exists in the living cell and its components:

> This paper describes molecular fine-tuning, how it can be used in biology, and how it challenges conventional Darwinian thinking. We also discuss the statistical methods underpinning fine-tuning and present a framework for such analysis.

What is called cosmic fine-tuning means that a number of natural constants have such values that life is possible. But the constants are still not so life-friendly that life could arise and develop through evolutionary processes, one thinks. Life would therefore not be possible without the intervention of a designer. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer claim to see clear traces of design in the cell's proteins and in its complex mechanisms. You get the image of a designer who doesn't quite manage to create a sufficiently life-friendly universe, and is therefore forced to build all living beings together, in the smallest detail. The universe is both life-friendly and life-hostile at the same time.

Now, fine-tuning is a notoriously hard-to-define term, so one is glad to actually get a definition:

> We define fine-tuning as an object with two properties: it must (a) be unlikely to have occurred by chance, under the relevant probability distribution (i.e. complex), and (b) conform to an independent or detached specification (i.e. specific).

The first condition is therefore that it is unlikely that the object in question could have arisen by pure chance. The second is that it must respond to some sort of independent specification. The question is whether it is possible to detect fine-tuning with advanced statistical methods:

> Is it possible to recognize fine-tuning in biological systems at the levels of functional proteins, protein groups and cellular networks? Can fine-tuning in molecular biology be formulated using state of the art statistical methods, or are the arguments just "in the eyes of the beholder"?

That complex biological structures cannot have been formed by pure chance is so obvious that one hardly needs advanced statistical methods to convince oneself of the matter. Worse is the concept of "specification"; how to define specification in concrete terms is a question the ID movement has wrestled with for decades, without coming to any solution. The article's discussion of the concept is purely mathematical, and contains no clues as to how specification could be demonstrated in practice. One refers to an article by George Montañez, "A unified model of complex specified information", but even that is completely mathematical and says nothing about how one could determine whether a certain structure or molecule is specified or not.

At the end of the article, section 7, it is written:

> Functional proteins, molecular machines and cellular networks are both unlikely when viewed as outcomes of a stochastic model, with a relevant probability distribution (having a small P(A)), and at the same time they conform to an independent or detached specification (the set A being defined in terms of specificity). These results are important and deduced from central phenomena of basic science.

It is therefore not possible to give an account of what specification actually means in practice. Instead, they refer to "central phenomena in basic science", without giving any reference. In the last paragraph they write:

 > A major conclusion of our work is that fine-tuning is a clear feature of biological systems. Indeed, fine-tuning is even more extreme in biological systems than in inorganic systems. It is detectable within the realm of scientific methodology.

This is simply not true. Since there is no working method to scientifically detect specificity in concrete biological systems, it has not been possible to demonstrate fine-tuning with scientific methods. It has therefore not been possible to conclude that fine-tuning is characteristic of biological systems. This is impossible because one cannot fulfill condition (b) in one's definition of fine tuning. It is also impossible for that reason that one does not present any concrete data or calculations to support one's claims. The statistical methods developed are not used to solve any actual problems. All you have is speculation.

The title of the article reads "Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning of molecular machines and systems". It makes it clear that statistical methods have been concretely applied to model fine-tuning - the word "using" reasonably means that something has really been used. In fact, no methods have been applied at all; nothing has been discussed besdides how it could be done.

It is difficult to understand that Thorvaldsen and Hössjer in this way make it appear that they have results they clearly do not have. The reader may get the impression that they are bluffing.

__Has Intelligent Design made a breakthrough as a science?__

___Introduction and background___

Last year, together with Steinar Thorvaldsen, who is Professor of Information Science at Tromsø University, I published the research article "Using statistical methods to model the fine-tuning of molecular machines and systems" in the journal Journal of Theoretical Biology. In this paper, hereafter referred to as TH2020, we propose a mathematical and statistical framework to test whether biological systems (proteins, complexes of proteins, cellular networks) can arise by chance or whether fine-tuning is a better explanation. Fine-tuning a system means that a number of different parameters must be finely calibrated for the system to exist. This requires (a) that the probability of the system having arisen by chance is small, and (b) that there is an independent specification of what is fine-tuned. This specification may mean that the system must have all its parts in place in order to function, that it has arisen in a short time despite its complexity, or that it includes codes, instructions, and organized structures that we recognize from intelligent senders.

In physics, the concept of fine-tuning has been used for 50 years and today a majority of physicists claim that the universe must be fine-tuned in order to exist and harbor life. Despite this, fine-tuning has not had the same impact in biology. One may ask why. One explanation is probably that in many examples fine-tuning is connected with an intelligent designer, which in turn brings to mind God. Although fine-tuning does not require a designer to formulate, this is generally the most reasonable interpretation or explanation of specification (b) above. This connection between fine-tuning and design has been central in Intelligent Design (ID), a movement that arose in the United States in the late 1980s with the aim of proposing alternative explanations for the origin and diversity of life, to the secular theories (chemical and biological evolution) which dominate within the academic world. And as a Christian, I can go a step further and identify the Intelligent Designer with God. With a creationist perspective, I can then use the Bible as inspiration to both propose and interpret specified properties of biological structures. Thus, while the ID movement goes "halfway" and identifies fine-tuning with a designer, creationists go "all the way" and interpret fine-tuning as something God created or brought about.

For my own part, I have both a creationist and an ID perspective. Depending on the research problem and context, I choose to either go half way or all the way in my interpretation of how the fine-tuning may have arisen, or to make no interpretation at all. In some cases it is appropriate to leave it to the reader to consider how the fine-tuning may have arisen, in other contexts it is important to justify that the proposed fine-tuning is inspired by the knowledge we have about intelligent senders, or by texts from the Bible. At the end of the aforementioned article, TH2020, Thorvaldsen and I go halfway and make a connection between fine-tuning and an intelligent source. As this is unusual in a secular academic environment, our publication has received a lot of attention and circulation. Last year, TH2020 was the most downloaded article in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.

Among those who got involved in the debate around TH2020 is Lars Johan Erkell, who is Associate Professor in Zoophysiology at the University of Gothenburg. On Biolog(g), a blog run by the Department of Biology and Environmental Science at the University of Gothenburg, in November 2020 Erkell wrote the article series "Breakthrough for Intelligent Design (?)", where he analyzes and comments on TH2020 in seven articles. As an academic, I welcome factual criticism where my research results are analyzed and seen at the seams. At best, such debates contribute to advancing science. I also want to thank Erkell for actually taking the time to read, not only TH2020, but also several of the articles that Steinar and I refer to. That makes parts of his criticism well-initiated. At the same time, Erkell's series of articles contains a series of claims, such as that our article is not only pseudo-scientific but also anti-scientific. I therefore want to take this opportunity to respond to this serious criticism. I have divided my response article into seven parts (corresponding to Erkell's seven articles) and a concluding summary.

___Part 1. The results of the fine-tuning article___

As mentioned in the introduction, the method for detecting fine-tuning in a biological system, which we propose in TH2020, involves two steps. First (a) to show that the probability is small that the system has arisen by chance and second (b) to demonstrate an external specification, which can be recognized by an observer. In part 1, Erkell asks what results are presented in TH2020. According to Erkell, our article containsn only mathematical speculations that are not relevant to a biological reality. In other words, Erkell lacks concrete examples where we show how our mathematical theory for detecting fine-tuning should be applied.

It is true that in TH2020 we do not have concrete calculation examples where we illustrate our theory. But this is not the purpose of the article either. The aim is partly to provide an overview of fine-tuning and partly to propose a mathematical framework for demonstrating fine-tuning, which can then be used in subsequent articles to investigate whether a certain biological system (a protein, a complex of proteins, a cellular network) is fine-tuned or not. At the same time, TH2020 contains about a hundred references to other articles, and in several cases we give concrete suggestions on how the specification in (b) should be chosen, as well as detailed justifications that the probability (a) that the biological system should have arisen by chance should be very small. In addition, several of the articles we refer to are based on empirical studies or analyzes of such. In other words, our mathematical model is not plucked out of thin air<sup>1</sup>.

At the same time, it is important to point out that mathematical models are simplifications of a more complicated biological reality. Whether the model is successful or not depends on how well it can describe empirical data. But this does not mean that every research article needs to contain such a connection between mathematics and empiricism, even if this connection is crucial in the long run. There are many examples of sciences (such as population genetics and theoretical ecology) which were indeed motivated by biological applications, but where the theory was initially developed quite separately from the empirical work. Despite this, population genetics later became an important tool for describing small-scale microevolution, when more genetic data became available. Similarly, theoretical ecology has been used to understand the processes that bring about environmental and climate change. My question to Erkell is therefore whether he considers that such a scenario in the history of science lacks value, where theory development sometimes precedes applications? Doesn't it rather indicate a diversity in the scientific project?

Hi Ola,

Thanks for commenting on my posts! There is a lot to discuss here, and I hope we can sort things out.

Let me start with your question about whether I think it is OK to publish theoretical articles without empirical data. Yes, of course! It can lead to faster progress. Like when one would start interpreting X-ray crystallographic diffraction patterns and the theory of space groups was already in place. So my criticism is not directed at you publishing a model without data, but that TH2020 clearly pretends to show (or "demonstrate")  results, but does not contain any. How can you interpret "A major conclusion of our work is that fine-tuning is a clear feature of biological systems ... It is detectable within the realm of scientific methodology" if not so that you have purely concrete results that show that fine-tuning actually exists in biological systems? I thought I expressed myself clearly here.

So to the problems with the concept of "specification". It's notoriously difficult to define and I can't find a clear definition or proper discussion of it in TH2020. But you suggest how it should be chosen, like "... a molecular machine, and that the specification states how many parts must be in place for x to work." Another example is that f(x) indicates the biological fitness of an organism x, i.e. its reproductive capacity”. But one is a structure, the other is a property of a living organism. What does a definition look like that covers these very different cases? And what determines the necessary number of parts in a molecular machine? Furthermore, in the next example, if we move an organism from a favorable environment, where it has high biological fitness, to an unfavorable environment, where it has zero fitness, does it lose its specification? It is still the same organism. And is the specification a quality or a quantity? You mention both options in section 6.2. Which is it? You have to look for a more blurred concept.

In this my first post, I had two points of criticism: 1) that you pretend to have results that do not exist, and 2) that you do not define or sufficiently discuss the term "specification". In your answer you avoid both points. Do you have any comment on that?

__How do you count on design?__

What stands out about Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's work, and what makes me write these blog posts, is that they raise the question of how one could demonstrate fine-tuning and design using scientific methods. In any case, how one could imagine doing; It doesn't get more concrete than that.

Thorvaldsen and Hössjer carefully discuss the statistical methods they use, or rather believe that one can use. The main line is – as always with ID – that you try to substantiate ID by primarily criticizing the theory of evolution. But you cannot prove theory A by showing that theory B is bad. The authors are also aware of this. They write in section 6.3:

> However, one may argue that the most suitable approach of science is to compare the best explanations found so far within two competing worldviews. This naturally leads to model selection. … It is possible for some problems to suggest a design model M1 that competes with the currently most promising naturalistic model M2, in terms of which model explains the data the best.

One therefore wants to compare an evolutionary model with a design model by using statistical methods to determine which of them is the most probable. And it is clear that the intention is to make the comparison based on concrete data. But from which models, and from which data?

In their critique of evolutionary theory, a number of well-known themes are addressed, primarily "irreducible complexity" on several levels; in individual proteins, in protein complexes and in entire networks. Also the "Cambrian explosion" and the so-called the waiting time problem is addressed. What these have in common is that they believe that the structures of life are so complex and thus so improbable that they could never arise naturally. However, this is not a view shared by established science – here the arguments are seen as constructed.

The question now is how concretely these problems could be calculated. A question that has been dealt with in detail - and which is probably the easiest to count on - concerns the probability that a functioning protein will be able to arise through naturalistic mechanisms. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer mention in section 4.2 two strategies for doing this:

The first is based on the fact that protein consists of one or more chains of amino acids that must be in a certain sequence. Since there are 20 different amino acids to choose from, there are countless combinations. In a small protein consisting of 150 amino acids, the different amino acids can be combined in 10<sup>50</sup> to 10<sup>74</sup> different ways. These are astronomically large numbers; the probability that the "right" combination would occur by chance is vanishingly small. The big problem with this strategy, however, is that no biologist in their right mind believes that proteins form in this random way.

The evolutionary biological view is instead that the first enzymes consisted of short peptide chains with a small number of amino acids – it is known that such can have enzymatic activity.<sup>1</sup> That such peptide chains could be formed by chance is not unreasonable. They may not have been as efficient as today's enzymes, but if they had sufficient enzyme activity, they could have been selected and evolved into larger and more efficient molecules. So no one believes that proteins are formed in the way that Thorvaldsen and Hössjer address here. It is a little strange that they mention this bizarre thought at all. It is completely irrelevant.

The other strategy is to set up a hypothetical evolutionary tree of how a certain protein could have evolved, and then calculate the probability of that process. But there is a lot of knowledge that is missing in order to be able to make credible calculations of this kind, not least because you have to count on an evolution that extends over billions of years. You would need detailed knowledge of which organisms are involved, mutation frequencies, population sizes, selection pressure and much else that is impossible to know in retrospect. This is not a realistic path. Nor, as far as I know, has anyone attempted to set up any detailed scenario of this kind.

The conclusion is that it is not practically possible to statistically calculate the probability that a protein could evolve via natural mechanisms. The difficulties are so enormous that it will probably never be possible. And yet it was the simplest of the cases that have been discussed.

<div align="center">***</div>

Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's strategy for demonstrating fine-tuning is based on a statistical comparison between a naturalistic model M2 and a design model M1. We then need to calculate the probability for both models in order to then be able to compare them. We have already seen that it is practically impossible to calculate the probability that a complex biological structure can arise according to a naturalistic model. But how do you calculate the likelihood of a design model? It is something the authors wisely do not go into. Here we are in a real bind.

In order to be able to calculate the probability of how a complex biological structure can arise, we must therefore have a credible and detailed model of the process. This also applies if there is a conscious design behind it. We must therefore have knowledge of the designer in order to assess the probability that the person concerned wanted his design exactly the way we see it to be. This requires detailed knowledge – we need to understand exactly how the designer thinks, what intentions, plans and means they have. In order to make statistical calculations, we must have concrete data, numbers.

However, the design movement is very careful not to say anything about who the designer would be, or what qualities the designer would have. This makes it fundamentally impossible to calculate the statistical probability of a design process. So it's not just practically impossible, as with the naturalistic model, it's fundamentally impossible.

The statistical model Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have put forward to demonstrate design is ill-conceived and useless – it is based on the unreasonable assumption that you can make a statistical estimate of the probability that an unknown designer would have acted in a certain way. It is a mystery that they chose to publish it.

__Part 2. About counting on design__

In order to be able to estimate the probability that a biological system should have arisen by chance (so step a) in the fine-tuning argument) a naturalistic model M2 is required that describes how development or evolution took place. The fact that the model is naturalistic means that it contains only natural explanatory mechanisms. When it comes to biological evolution, i.e. the development of complicated life forms from simple single-celled organisms, the five naturalistic mechanisms are usually involved i) mutations, ii) genetic drift, i.e. random variation in how reproductive the individuals in a parental generation are, iii) natural selection, iv) recombinations of genetic material from a pair of parents, and v) the mixing of gene pools caused by geographic migration.

Erkell claims that it is practically impossible to give a reasonable estimate of the probability that, for example, a protein could have evolved in accordance with a naturalistic model M2. I agree that this is extremely difficult, since such a model must necessarily be complicated, with more or less unknown parameters. Nevertheless, I believe that there is a feasible way to demonstrate the difficulty of naturalistic processes in producing complex structures. If you only focus on certain properties of the protein that according to M2 must have evolved, you get a conservative upper estimate of the probability that a protein was obtained through evolutionary processes. To also take into account the fact that several of the model's parameters (such as selection pressure, mutation rate, population sizes, generation times, etc.) can be difficult to estimate from the data with good accuracy, a so-called sensitivity analysis can be used to calculate how the upper estimate of the probability for the development of the protein changes when the constituent parameters change. If this upper estimate of the probability is small for all biologically reasonable values of the included parameters, an argument has been given for the difficulty of the proposed naturalistic model M2 to explain the origin of the given protein. I therefore argue, contrary to Erkell, that the first step a) of our method for detecting fine-tuning is highly feasible in practice.

The second part b) of our fine-tuning argument consists in finding a measure f(x) of how specified a biological system x is. As mentioned in the introduction, f(x) fastens on some characteristic that the observer recognizes, and which in many cases brings to mind that an intelligent designer is behind the origin of the system. In TH2020 we give several examples of how the system x and its specification f(x) can be chosen. An example is that x corresponds to a protein or a molecular machine, and that the specification indicates how many parts must be in place for x to function. Another example is that f(x) indicates the biological fitness of an organism x, i.e. its reproductive capacity. In connection with the latter example, we argue in TH2020 that evolution will eventually break down the genetic material of a species because most mutations are harmful or neutral. The consequence is then that the fitness of individuals of the species decreases over time. This in turn means that the probability in a) becomes very low for an evolutionary model M2, based on the aforementioned mechanisms i)-v), to be able to explain that the organism in question arose during millions of years of development, because the genetic material during such long time has had time to be depleted.

But if a naturalistic model M2 has difficulty explaining the emergence of a biological system that contains some form of specification, the question is whether there is any other better explanatory model. At the end of TH2020, we give examples of design- or creationist-inspired models M1 that we believe have greater possibilities than M2 to explain the emergence of the fine-tuned system. To make such reasoning more rigorous, it is necessary to show that the probability of the emergence of the given system is much higher for the design model M1 than for the naturalistic model M2. In the example above, where f(x) corresponds to the biological fitness of an organism x, we refer to various articles where a design model is described, which in addition to the aforementioned (micro)evolutionary mechanisms i)-v) adds a sixth mechanism vi) in the form of genetic variation in a first created pair, from which all individuals in the species descend. According to such a design model M1, the emergence of species can be explained by a combination of created variation (mechanism vi) and a short-term, small-scale microevolution (mechanisms i-v). The problem of genetic depletion then becomes much less, because the created variation makes it possible to assume that the species arose relatively recently, so that the genetic erosion, caused by the harmful mutations, acted for a much shorter time<sup>2</sup>.

Erkell is strongly critical of us introducing a design model to explain the emergence of a biological system. He writes:

> In order to be able to calculate the probability of how a complex biological structure can arise, we must therefore have a credible and detailed model of the process. This also applies if there is a conscious design behind it. We must therefore have knowledge of the designer in order to assess the probability that the person concerned wanted his design exactly the way we see it to be. This requires detailed knowledge – we need to understand exactly how the designer thinks, what intentions, plans and means they have. In order to make statistical calculations, we must have concrete data, numbers.
>
> However, the design movement is very careful not to say anything about who the designer would be, or what qualities the designer would have. This makes it fundamentally impossible to calculate the statistical probability of a design process. It is thus not only practically impossible, as with the naturalistic model, it is fundamentally impossible.

I completely agree with Erkell that it is difficult to determine exactly what plans or intentions a designer has. But this is also not necessary to know. It is enough to let design-inspired thinking generate concrete falsifiable hypotheses. A design-inspired model can therefore be perfectly combined with the hypothetical-deductive method, which forms the basis of empirical science, according to the following three steps:

1) Propose a falsifiable hypothesis, which can contain both natural mechanisms and design-inspired parts.
2) Evaluate and see if the hypothesis in 1) is consistent with the data.
3) If the agreement in 2) is not good, go back to 1) and propose a better hypothesis.

Erkell makes very far-reaching, not to say unreasonable demands on the design model, because he is not satisfied with falsifiable hypotheses. Instead, he also wants to include characteristics of the designer that can often be difficult to test scientifically. Although it is probably so interesting to have a conversation about what intentions the designers have, this has to do with the interpretation and the reason for the emergence of hypotheses, which is not required for the hypothetico-deductive method. One can thus use more or less intuitive design arguments to formulate testable hypotheses, without having to test the reasoning that led to the formulation of the hypotheses.

Furthermore, Erkell's reasoning backfires like a boomerang on himself. Shouldn't he make the same rigorous demands on naturalistic models M2, where the interpretation of them is included? How, for example, should chance in an evolutionary model be explained? Is it epistemic chance (as a way of describing lack of knowledge), ontological chance (genuine non-determinism) or should quantum mechanics be used to explain the emergence of chance? Which interpretation of quantum mechanics should be used in that case? If these questions cannot be given an unequivocal answer, Erkell risks sawing off the secular branch of science he himself has set himself up for.

2) This is usually called Haldane's dilemma. A historical overview of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural selection (which is closely related to Haldane's Dilemma) is given in Basener W., Cordova S., Hössjer O. and Sanford J. (2021).

In this section, we get into the core of the work, your statistical model to detect fine-tuning/design. It assumes that one can calculate the probability that a biological structure can evolve via natural mechanisms, an extremely difficult task. You write that you can make meaningful estimates of the probability of a protein being able to evolve by doing a sensitivity analysis of an upper estimate of this probability. If the variation of this estimate is small for all biologically plausible values of the involved parameters, one would have an argument for the difficulty of the proposed naturalistic model.

But how do you get "all biologically reasonable values"? It is not enough to count on a single gene – genes (and proteins) interact in complex networks, and selection pressure acts on the entire network. The interaction between genes is called epistasis, and it must be included in your model. Ecology is also crucial because the selection pressure is entirely dependent on the organism's environment. The problem is that there are astronomically many possibilities for epistatic (and ecological) interactions, and you have no clues as to which might be the relevant ones. You cannot count on a certain protein "all else being equal"; because the genome is constantly changing, "all else is not equal". All of this means that you are nowhere near a realistic model of an evolution that has taken place in countless steps over millions or billions of years.

Apart from all this, there is also a fundamental flaw in the approach, namely that it assumes the probability of a process with a definite goal in the form of a definite structure (at least that's how ID advocates usually count). But evolutionary processes have no goal. As far as proteins and protein complexes are concerned, there are an awful lot of structures that have the same or similar function, and it is one of these that will be selected. It is thus the probability that the function - not the exact structure - will evolve that is important.

In any case, you mean that "our method of detecting fine-tuning is highly feasible". If so, why haven't you done it? Why don't you at least have a discussion of which factors would be included in such a calculation, how they should be identified, how they should be estimated, how they should be weighed against each other, etc.? Then—and only then—would this article be interesting. It would be even more interesting if you could succeed with the second part of your method, namely calculating the probability of design. If you are to test the probability that a certain structure is designed, you must know the characteristics of the designer - design is an act of will, and it is the probability of that act of will that you must calculate. And that is of course impossible without in-depth knowledge of the designer. You don't write anything about how this would happen, and that doesn't surprise me; I suspect you have no idea. At least I don't have it. But this is necessary if you want to be able to compare M1 and M2. That comparison is the very core of your method. But you comment on it like this:

"Erkell makes very far-reaching, not to say unreasonable, demands on the design model, because he is not satisfied with falsifiable hypotheses. Instead, he also wants to include characteristics of the designer that can often be difficult to test scientifically."

There's no getting away from this: the probability of a design hypothesis includes the probability that a designer really wants to accomplish a certain thing. Without intention no design. If we imagine an omnipotent designer (which you probably do) it is only an act of will; no practical complications exist. But I get curious; you write "characteristics of the designer that can often be difficult to test scientifically", which must mean that there are actually characteristics of the designer that can be scientifically tested. Who are they? How can you test them? Here we get into really central questions about scientific hypotheses. That discussion is so important and extensive that it hardly fits in the comments section. I have therefore written a separate post on the matter, ["Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design"](https://biologg.wordpress.com/2021/09/08/vetenskap-hypoteser-och-intelligent-design/).

In your comment you also touch on completely different things: you talk about "genetic erosion" and refer in a footnote to "Haldane's dilemma". Here you are mixing two things. Haldane's dilemma is not about some kind of erosion but about how fast evolution can go, more specifically if there was enough time for the gene substitutions that must have taken place from the time of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees until today. The genetic erosion you speak of is John Sanford's genetic entropy, a completely different matter. It would consist of a slow and inevitable genetic decay that would lead to our demise. However, neither Sanford nor anyone else has been able to show that this decay actually takes place. Sanford builds on an earlier, now dismissed, idea that a genetic "catastrophe" could occur if enough harmful mutations accumulate in a genome. However, it has never been shown that such catastrophes actually take place, but rather that they do not [(Springman, R. et al: Evolution at a High Imposed Mutation Rate: Adaptation Obscures the Load in Phage T7. Genetics (2010)184: 221 –232)](https://www.genetics.org/content/184/1/221); [Summers, J., Litwin, S.: Examining The Theory of Error Catastrophe. J. Virol., (2006) 80, 20–260](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1317512/)). So forget about genetic entropy.

In conclusion, you suggest that I should place the same strict demands on my own research as I do on yours. But that's exactly what I do - I make the same demands on your research that I myself have to live up to. Regarding your question about chance, I (and my colleagues) start from an ontological chance, because chemical reactions are based on the interaction between elementary particles and these are subject to the quantum laws in their so-called. Copenhagen interpretation. This is the basis of molecular orbital theory, and thus of chemistry and biology, I was once taught.

# Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 3) #
November 13, 2020

by Lars Johan Erkell

**Miracles as science?**

Thorvaldsen and Hössjer give a number of examples of systems that one thinks are suitable for the statistical model we discussed in the previous post. One of the examples concerns human evolution.

> One may also study the more restricted problem of human/chimp ancestry, and compare a model M2 with common ancestry of the two species, with a unique origin model M1, according to which each species is founded by one single couple (Sanford and Carter, 2014; Hössjer et al., 2016a; 2016b, Carter et al., 2018, Hössjer and Gauger, 2019).

Since Thorvaldsen and Hössjer raise this question as suitable to study with their statistical model, we shall look at it more closely.

The question one asks is whether it is possible that humanity has its origins in a single couple, a man and a woman. It is of course about Adam and Eve, even if they are not mentioned by name - otherwise there is hardly any reason to ask the question. The common scientific view is that humans did not originate in two individuals, but that our species passed a bottleneck perhaps 70,000 years ago, when there were perhaps 10,000 individuals. One can of course imagine that the bottleneck was only two individuals, but to be able to explain the genetic variation we see today, we then have to extend the time to 500,000 years or more. This does not do for a young earth creationist scenario. There, creation must have taken place 6,000 to 10,000 years ago if you want to be able to read the Bible literally.

You can see that Ola Hössjer is a co-author in three of the referenced articles: Genetic Modeling of Human History Part 1- Comparison of Common Descent and Unique Origin Approaches and Genetic Modeling of Human History Part 2: A Unique Origin Algorithm, both from 2016. Here reports he, along with two co-authors, developed a population genetic model to simulate human descent. Together with biologist Ann Gauger (who is affiliated with the Discovery Institute), he has also written A Single-Couple Human Origin is Possible from 2019, where they developed their earlier model. It is written there that an origin from a single couple 500,000 years ago is consistent with the model, but that only small changes in the model can give an age of 100,000 years or less.

The three articles are published in the online journal BIO-complexity, published by the Discovery Institute, the central organization of the ID movement. The journal is not recognized as a "real" scientific journal. For example, it is not included in the scientific database SCOPUS.

In the article Genetic Modeling of Human History Part 1- Comparison of Common Descent and Unique Origin Approaches from 2016, one reads on the first page:

> We argue that a unique origin model where humanity arose from one single couple with created diversity seems to explain the data at least as well, if not better.

Ola Hössjer and his co-authors thus say that their model that humans originated in a single pair matches the data better than the standard evolutionary model. But what data? The only thing you find is qualitative reasoning about published data of various kinds. Neither of the two articles with the title Genetic Modeling of Human History contains any "Genetic Modeling"; no quantitative data, no results from simulations with the model developed. The approach is recognizable from Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's current article (see the first post in the series). Here you also pretend results you don't have.

<div align="center">***</div>

The quote also talks about "Created diversity". Now what is it? I have never heard of such a thing before. The text discusses five different mechanisms for how genetic variation can develop and be limited. But then you face a sixth possibility. The authors write on page 5:

> … But if an intelligent designer is invoked as a possible explanation, and if humanity originates from one single couple, it is possible that their chromosomes were created with considerable diversity from the beginning [19,20]. This gives us a sixth mechanism of genetic change.
>
> VI. Created founder diversity is biologically plausible for DNA of non-sex chromosomes. Since there are four copies of each non-sex chromosome in two individuals, we may think of one of the founding male's two copies as a reference or template for the other three. All differences between his reference chromosome and the other three founder chromosomes can be thought of as a very large number of mutations, all of which occurred in one generation. Since the founding pair had three copies of the X-chromosome (one in the man and two in the woman), for the same reason they may also have been different. Some founder diversity is possible for mitochondrial DNA as well. Since the founding female carried hundreds of mitochondria that could have been diverse, it is possible that she passed on some of that diversity to her daughters.

The genome contains two copies of each gene. The idea is that Adam and Eve would have been created with two different variants of each gene in their DNA, which together would give four variants. That would increase genetic variation so much that one could imagine a creation 6,000 to 10,000 years ago. References 19 and 20 do not go to the scientific literature, but to two creationist journals. The first of the two articles does not justify why introducing an engineered genetic variation would be scientifically justified. However, the other one, On the origin of eukaryotic species' genotypic and phenotypic diversity: Genetic clocks, population growth curves, and comparative nuclear genome analyzes suggest created heterozygosity in combination with natural processes as a major mechanism, by Nathaniel Jeanson and Jason Lisle, does. They write on p. 86-87:

> No known non-miraculous mechanism exists that could play a role in this process, and invoking miracles at every juncture without biblical or scientific justification quickly moves a hypothesis from the realm of science to the realm of ad hoc speculation.
>
> …
> On an individual organism level, hypotheses must invoke observable processes or biblically-justified miraculous processes. 
> …
> Again, observable processes or biblically-justified miraculous processes must be invoked, or the hypothesis quickly drifts into the realm of the ad hoc.

A hypothesis could thus be justified either scientifically or with the support of the Bible. However, I find no discussion of exactly how the Bible can justify God creating Adam and Eve with maximum genetic variation. Ola Hössjer and co-authors thus refer to a created variation that is not justified either scientifically or biblically.

But surely this is a convenient explanation. Invoking a designer suddenly makes it possible that genetic variation may be greater than established science admits, and that Adam and Eve may have lived 6,000 to 10,000 years ago. It is not seen as necessary to show that there really is a designer or that the person concerned really had the desire to create exactly the genetic variation one needs.

There are problems with this model. Without going into the genetics, one can for example state that in this model there can be a maximum of four gene variants - alleles - of a certain gene. However, there are gene families with thousands of alleles. Where do they come from? But if you have started to explain things with miracles, you can certainly solve those problems as well.

And where does the designer come from? Out of thin air. A designer has been invented that creates genetic variation to solve the problem that Adam and Eve must not have lived hundreds of thousands of years ago. And thus they have completely left science and floated out into the world of fantasy.

<div align="center">***</div>

If Ola Hössjer were faced with a new statistical model that was based on an unproven theorem, I think he would react sharply. Theorems must be proven, otherwise one cannot know that they are true. If there is any part in the derivation of the model that is unproven, it cannot be used. Grabbing something out of thin air – a theorem or something else – is called ad hoc assumption and is not allowed in scientific activity. If you can't get your theory together, you can't just pull something to save it. All parts of a mathematical derivation or a biological theory must be based on knowledge, not on grabbing something out of thin air when needed.

Nevertheless, this is exactly what Ola Hössjer and co-authors are doing. The introduction of a supernatural designer makes their work lose all scientific credibility and thus all scientific interest.

Let me add that in principle you can think of a designer as a scientific explanation, provided you know for sure that the designer exists, and has such properties that they can explain a certain phenomenon. If we have certain knowledge about the designer (as we have about the five genetic mechanisms discussed) we can use that knowledge to explain things. But in this case we have no knowledge of the designer at all. And then we cannot use design as an explanation.

__Part 3: Miracles and Science__

In part 3, Erkell makes a detour and comments on a number of articles on the origin of man that I wrote in collaboration with Ann Gauger and Colin Reeves<sup>3</sup>.  In these articles we use the design model M1 that was described in part 2 in a creationist context. More precisely, our model M1 assumes that all humans are descended from a first couple, Adam and Eve. The model thus includes the aforementioned microevolutionary mechanisms (i)-(v), as well as that Adam and Eve were created with genetic variation (vi). In other words, according to this model, Adam has two genetically different copies of each non-sex chromosome, and so does Eve. Thus we get four genetically different variants of each non-sex chromosome in the first generation. The degree of genetic dissimilarity between these variants, i.e. the degree of created variation, is a parameter that can be varied in the model.

Erkell calls our creationist model M1 a miracle model (which, by the way, I think is a good name<sup>4</sup>), and he makes similar high demands on this model as on the design model in the previous section:

"A hypothesis could thus be justified either scientifically or with the support of the Bible. However, I find no discussion of exactly how the Bible can justify God creating Adam and Eve with maximum genetic variation. Ola Hössjer and co-authors thus refer to a created variation that is not justified either scientifically or biblically."

To support his thesis, Erkell starts from the quote "On an individual organism level, hypotheses must invoke observable processes or biblically-justified miraculous processes" by the creationists Jeanson and Lisle.<sup>5</sup> I support this formulation, if the purpose is to choose between a creationist model M1 and a naturalistic model M2. But the fact that a hypothesis can be justified based on the Bible does not mean that it is a direct quote from a Bible verse. Erkell has simply misunderstood how creationist research is conducted. In fact, it is perfectly possible to let the Bible inspire the formulation of falsifiable hypotheses. In other words, creationism can be reconciled with the hypothetical deductive method, regardless of whether we start from direct biblical quotations or are inspired by the content of the Bible, according to the following three steps:

1) Propose a falsifiable hypothesis that can partly contain natural explanatory mechanisms and partly such if inspired by the Bible.
2) Evaluate and see if the hypothesis in 1) is consistent with the data.
3) If the agreement in 2) is not good, go back to 1) and propose a better hypothesis

As a Christian, I believe that God wrote two books, the Bible and nature. Therefore, it is ultimately God who is behind what we call "natural explanations" as well as the "biblically motivated explanations". Of course, one must place the same demands on a creationist model M1 as on a secular model M2. Erkell argues that our proposed creationist miracle model is firstly ad hoc and secondly not falsifiable. I believe that both of these statements are completely false. It says in the Bible that man was created uniquely. Given this, I mean that it is not at all a far-fetched ad hoc assumption to assume that God created Adam and Eve with genetic variation, because He is creative and did not want all men and women to be alike, like identical twins. By creating the first two humans with variation, the risk of inbreeding depression was also reduced when harmful mutations in future generations made their way in.

Note, however, that we only include created variation in our model, not why God created the two humans with variation. Given this, the model is falsifiable, because then, due to recombinations (iv), our DNA is a mosaic of the four building blocks from each chromosome, with which Adam and Eve were created. Such building blocks, called haplotype blocks, were discovered by secular scientists about 20 years ago. We mention this in two of our articles, with numerous references<sup>6</sup>. Either Erkell has missed these references or he has not realized that the existence of haplotype blocks makes our miracle model falsifiable. And regardless of whether the haplotype blocks are identified or not, I still believe that our miracle model is falsifiable, since there are indirect methods of testing the presence of created variation by comparing the allele frequency spectra and linkage disequilibrium plots calculated from the data with those predicted by the miracle model M1. This is exactly what we use in one of our publications to test M1 against the data<sup>7</sup>. However, Erkell (in part 5 of his article series) objects to our way of fitting the miracle model to the data:

"Then you add an unknown designer as a sixth mechanism. Then all opportunities to conduct a fact-based discussion disappear; we have no idea when or how such a designer would intervene. Hössjer and his colleagues seem to assume that the designer would create just enough genetic variation that their model fits. How can they know that? How can they test their model? It's not possible. You have simply invented a designer who has the qualities you want.”

Here Erkell confuses two things, firstly, whether the miracle model M1 is falsifiable or not, which I have already commented on, and secondly, how the adaptation of the model to the data has been done. All statistical models contain unknown parameters, so does our miracle model. This is precisely why the data is used to estimate the degree of variation created. It is no stranger than an evolutionary biologist, fitting a naturalistic model M2 to the data, estimating mutation rates, population sizes, and recombination rates. Of course, you can overfit if you use a model with too many parameters, without validating it. But in my and Ann Gauger's article, on the contrary, we used a very simple model with created variation, but without geographic variation (v). We also managed to get a good fit of our miracle model to the data, if Adam and Eve lived several hundred thousand years ago. However, we write that with a larger (and more realistic) variant of the miracle model, the age of the first two people can probably be lowered significantly. In addition, it is perfectly possible to test the miracle model by first estimating parameters on a data set (so-called training of the model) and then evaluating how well the obtained model adapts to another data set (so-called validation of the model).

Erkell finally delivers a third critique of the miracle model:

“There are problems with this model. Without going into the genetics, one can for example state that in this model there can be a maximum of four gene variants - alleles - of a certain gene. However, there are gene families with thousands of alleles. Where do they come from? But if you start to explain things with miracles, you can certainly solve those problems too."

This is a rather astonishing statement from a biologist. In fact, it is perfectly possible to explain gene families with a large number of alleles in a model where Adam and Eve were created with variation. Although there were only four raw copies of each non-sex chromosome in the first generation, mutations (i) and recombination (iv) in future generations can generate a large number of variants of different genes.

Erkell concludes Part 3 of his article series by asking how I, as a mathematician, can allow models with ad hoc assumptions:

"If Ola Hössjer was faced with a new statistical model that was based on an unproven theorem, I think he would react sharply. Theorems must be proven, otherwise one cannot know that they are true. If there is any part in the derivation of the model that is unproven, it cannot be used. Grabbing something out of thin air – a theorem or something else – is called ad hoc assumption and is not allowed in scientific activity. If you can't get your theory together, you can't just pull something to save it. All parts of a mathematical derivation or a biological theory must be based on knowledge, not on grabbing something out of thin air when needed.”

There is much to say about these sentences. First, Erkell confuses mathematics (a deductive science) with biology (an empirical or inductive science). In mathematics, one starts from axioms (assumptions of faith) and proves given these various statements. Here, the demands on accuracy are high, because a single small error can overturn an entire proof. However, in mathematics there are no requirements for a theorem to correspond to reality (despite this, mathematics has nevertheless proven to be very useful). In biology, the aim is instead to adapt models to empirical data, using the hypothetico-deductive method (and here mathematics comes in as a tool). It is therefore never possible to prove that a biological theory is true, on the other hand, you falsify models that do not match the data and make plausible models that have so far survived all tests. Of course, even in biology you have to be strict when proposing and testing models against data, but as I have shown above, our miracle model is firstly not ad hoc and secondly falsifiable.

4) Our sixth mechanism for genetic change, created variation (we), assumes that this is part of God's creation. However, miracles are generally defined as exceptions to the natural laws that God has already created, see for example Keener, C.S. (2011), Miracles, the credibility of the New Testament accounts, Baker Academics, Grand Rapids, Hössjer, O. (2018). Becoming a Christian, Combining prior belief, evidence, and will. Wipf and Stock Publishers, Eugene, OR, and Grenholm (2019), Documented Miracles, Sjöberg Publishers. Alternatively, all of God's creation can be seen as a miracle, and so I don't mind using the miracle model to denote our creationist explanatory model for human genetic variation, as suggested by Erkell.

6) See section 3C in Hössjer et al. (2016a) and section 1.3 in Hössjer et al. (2016b). Note, however, that created variation can be defined in different ways. For example, all of Eva's egg cells, which were with her from the beginning, may have been created differently. However, we have chosen to make our model of created variation as simple as possible, assuming that all of Eve's eggs were genetically identical. However, one can think of different (falsifiable) models for created variation.

In this section we return to the question of how to formulate scientific hypotheses. I refer to my discussion in the post "Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design" https://biologg.wordpress.com/2021/09/08/vetenskap-hypoteser-och-intelligent-design/.

So you find it astonishing that I, as a biologist, do not agree that today's genetic diversity could be explained on the basis that Adam and Eve must have lived 6000 years ago. But it's not just me who thinks so. I assume that you know that Steve Schaffner and Joshua Swamidass, with their respective allele frequency spectra and recombination analysis, concluded that from a genetic point of view it is indeed quite possible that Adam and Eve could have existed, but that they must have lived at least 500,000 years ago (see eg http://richardbuggs.com/2021/03/15/video-adam-eve-and-human-genetic-diversity/). In your own article "A Single-Couple Human Origin is Possible" (https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2019.1) you and Ann Gauger arrive at the same results. So why are you surprised that I don't believe genetics shows a creation 6000 years ago?

The critical point here is whether there are genetic mechanisms that in 6000 years can generate today's genetic variation from a single pair. You write "Even if there were only four raw copies of each non-sex chromosome in the first generation, mutations (i) and recombination (iv) in future generations can generate a large number of variants of different genes". Here's one thing I have to ask you: one of the main points of young earth creationism is that mutations are basically always harmful and destructive. They would cause irreversible losses of "information" and an ever-increasing "genetic entropy". Are you prepared to argue against this that mutations and recombinations (which are a form of random mutation) can generate new, functional alleles of a gene? HLA-B, the gene with the most variation to my knowledge, was reported in June 2021 to have 8,181 alleles. So can a blind process of random mutation and selection generate thousands of functional, new gene variants?

# Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 4) #
November 13, 2020

by Lars Johan Erkell

__Non-physical information?__

Towards the end of the article, the authors look ahead, towards a future Design Science. We read in the last paragraph:

> Biologists need richer conceptual resources than the physical sciences until now have been able to initiate, in terms of complex structures having non-physical information as input (Ratzsch, 2010).

Thorvaldsen and Hössjer refer to a book chapter by the philosopher Del Ratzsch, who discusses the epistemological question of whether science can in principle exclude non-material explanations<sup>1</sup>. If you now open the book and look at what Del Ratzsch has actually written, you read on page 356:

> Biologists need richer conceptual resources than the physical sciences have been able to generate. Historically, design-linked ideas have provided such resources and those resources have been, and continue to be, scientifically fruitful in biology.

This is really bad. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have distorted the quote so that it has come to mean something completely different. Del Ratzsch does not mention "non-physical information" in his text at all. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have invented that.

The cheating is also revealing. Steinar Thorvaldsen is a professor of information theory, and if "non-physical information" had been a term used in the subject, he would of course have referred to the scientific literature. Instead, a quote attributed to a philosopher has been fabricated. It is proof that "non-physical information" does not exist as an established scientific concept.

But what in the world do you think "non-physical information" would be? The information processing in any case I've heard of is always tied to matter of some kind: a brain or a computer. The information is always carried by some material medium, such as visible symbols, sound waves, patterns of magnetization, electromagnetic radiation or something else. The information itself consists, as far as I can understand, of a pattern or structure in the material medium. But how can there be pattern or structure in something that does not exist? Could "non-physical information" somehow float freely in space? Where does it come from? How could it affect matter? How do we even know it exists?

If Thorvaldsen and Hössjer now want to revolutionize biology as well as information theory, they can come up with some kind of argument. But not; that "non-physical information" would exist is an ad hoc claim, something they grabbed completely out of thin air.

So I wonder about the claim that biologists would need "richer conceptual resources" than what the physical sciences can offer. I can reveal that as a biologist I have never felt such a need in my research. Nor can I recall any colleague ever expressing any desire to go outside the physical sciences, or the matter being discussed at all at conferences or in the scientific literature. These are fantasies.

Had this been a normal scientific article, the authors would have justified the sensational claims they make in the quote above, and discussed them in relation to the scientific literature. But this isn't a normal scientific paper, so they don't. It is not wrong to speculate, but Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have obviously completely lost touch with reality.

__Part 4: What is information?__

In his fourth article, Erkell discusses the concept of information, which has been central to telecommunications theory for over 70 years. In TH2020, we argue that information has great potential to also be used in biology. This is well in line with what I wrote earlier, since information is closely related to our proposed method of demonstrating fine-tuning<sup>8</sup>. At the end of our article, we write that "non-physical information" is a concept that can make valuable contributions to biology, as one of several input parameters in biological models. In this context, we refer to an article by the American philosophy professor Del Ratzsch, who argues that design can make valuable contributions to biology. Erkell is very critical of our way of referring to Del Ratsch, and writes:

"This is really bad. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have distorted the quote so that it has come to mean something completely different. Del Ratzsch does not mention "non-physical information" in his text at all. Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have invented that.

The cheating is also revealing. Steinar Thorvaldsen is a professor of information theory, and if "non-physical information" had been a term used in the subject, he would of course have referred to the scientific literature. Instead, a quote attributed to a philosopher has been fabricated. It is proof that "non-physical information" does not exist as an established scientific concept.

But what in the world do you think "non-physical information" would be? The information processing in any case I've heard of is always tied to matter of some kind: a brain or a computer. The information is always carried by some material medium, such as visible symbols, sound waves, patterns of magnetization, electromagnetic radiation or something else. The information itself consists, as far as I can understand, of a pattern or structure in the material medium. But how can there be pattern or structure in something that does not exist? Could "non-physical information" somehow float freely in space? Where does it come from? How could it affect matter? How do we even know it exists?”

In these paragraphs, Erkell mixes up two concepts, on the one hand how information is conveyed and stored, and on the other hand how information arises. I completely agree with Erkell that information does not float in the air but is stored in some physical medium. What we are referring to in TH2020 is the emergence of information, which can be both physical and non-physical. A few sentences before we use the term non-physical information in TH2020, we write:

"One rather needs a specificity function that, although of non-physical origin, can be quantified and measured empirically in terms of physical properties such as functionality."

Putting our introduced concept of non-physical information into context, it is thus clear that we mean the emergence and not the storage of information. Erkell further claims that we invented the concept of non-physical information. But while information theorists may not use that exact term, it's not out of thin air. Here I would like to especially mention the Italian philosophy professor Luciano Floridi's division into different types of information. Floridi distinguishes between "environmental information" and "semantic information", where only the former type of information has a physical origin (such as cloud formations can give us information about the weather an hour later).<sup>9</sup> Semantic information, on the other hand, conveys a meaning to the recipient , and unless one has a reductionist worldview (which Del Ratzsch does not, by the way), it is natural to identify semantic information with non-physical information, even if Floridi does not use the latter concept. 

Semantic information can in turn be divided into instructions/algorithms and factual information (statements of fact). As far as I know, no one has succeeded in showing that semantic information can arise through purely material processes. Since biological systems (eg the DNA code) convey semantic information, it is hardly far-fetched to claim that this concept constitutes a valuable concept in biology. Arguably, such semantic information that can be physically measured and quantified (so that it can form the basis of falsifiable hypotheses) constitutes a potentially important type of specification. In TH2020 we write that a very interesting future research area is to find different ways to quantify semantic (or non-physical) information.

At the end of Part 4, Erkell discusses whether biologists need to include non-physical explanatory hypotheses in their models:

"Then I wonder about the claim that biologists would need "richer conceptual resources" than what the physical sciences can offer. I can reveal that as a biologist I have never felt such a need in my research. Nor can I recall any colleague ever expressing any desire to go outside the physical sciences, or the matter being discussed at all at conferences or in the scientific literature. These are fantasies.”

I see this as a very weak argument. Whether non-material processes are relevant in biology is not primarily determined by what the majority of biologists write about in research papers or speak about at conferences. First, it is mainly for those parts of biology that deal with questions of origin, that meaning and other non-material concepts have a really great potential. Secondly, biology as a science is strongly governed by a secular way of thinking (see part 5) and therefore it is hardly surprising that a large proportion of all biologists do not use non-material explanations as working tools. Third, many natural scientists have long argued that information has a non-physical origin. The founder of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, believed that information cannot be attributed to matter or energy, and the well-known American physicist John Archibald Wheeler coined the concept "It from Bit" in the same spirit, that is, everything originates in information, measured in the unit Bits<sup>10</sup>. In addition, there are several biologists who point out that the concepts of meaning and codes are important tools in biology, something that Erkell does not seem to have noticed<sup>11</sup>.

8) In more detail, if P=P(f(X)≥f(x)|M2) is the probability of randomly observing a system X that is at least as specified as the observed system x, given the naturalistic model M2, then I=-log_2(P) denotes the degree of functional information in the system, see Hazen, R.M. etc. (2007). Functional information and the emergence of bio-complexity. Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States 104 (suppl 1), 8574-8581. In order to demonstrate fine-tuning, the functional information I is required to be large enough. This in turn requires that a function f measuring the degree of specification be defined (step b in our fine-tuning definition) and that the probability P of achieving this specification by chance under model M2 is small (step a in our fine-tuning definition). If the specification f also conveys a meaning to the recipient, then I corresponds to semantic (or non-physical) information. Note that functional and semantic information differ from syntactic information (or Shannon information) in that the probability P must be tied to a specification f.

The concept of information constantly comes up in discussions about ID. You mean that I make a mistake when I do not distinguish between information and the origin of the information. But you yourselves don't make that distinction in TH2020, it appeared in your comment above. The cause of the information could thus be non-physical, and that the information could then be transferred and stored in physical media. But how would that happen? How can something non-physical (whatever that would be) control physical processes? To progress here, you need to solve the body-soul problem, a philosophical classic.

So it was interesting that you confirm that "non-physical" information does not exist as a concept within the established information theory. Instead, in your article you have referred to a philosopher who does not use the term. In your reply above, you now refer to another philosopher who also does not use the term. I maintain that you plucked the non-physical information out of thin air. Because what should one say when you write that "it [is] natural to identify semantic information with non-physical information". Is it? Semantic information is interpreted in our material brains, and in that sense is physical, or at least associated with physical structures. From what I understand, it also cannot exist without physical structures. To me, it doesn't feel natural at all to identify semantic information with non-physical information. That the thought feels natural to you, I suspect, is due to the fact that you, as a dualist, place the thinking in a non-material soul. In any case, mere feeling is not enough to establish revolutionary concepts such as "non-physical information".

You also write that "biological systems (for example the DNA code) convey semantic information". I want to question that. Semantic information conveys a meaning to the receiver, which presupposes a consciousness that interprets the information. Who/what interprets the DNA code in the cell? The ribosome, which would be the structure that "interprets" the DNA information during protein synthesis, does not think. Each step in the process occurs through chance and physical necessity. Protein synthesis is well studied, and we can see that its various steps consist of physical interactions between physical molecules. The same goes for every other cellular process I know of. Strictly speaking, we do not need information theory to understand the molecular processes in the cell. The fact that we still use the concept of information is due, I believe, to the fact that we are already familiar with it and that it makes it easier for us to understand how the cell works. Having said that, I still hope that information theory can be developed so that we get new tools to understand what happens in the cell.

You further write that "Whether non-material processes are relevant in biology is not primarily determined by what the majority of biologists write about in research articles or speak about at conferences". It is true that biologists, like everyone else, have their limitations, but who would be better placed to judge biology's need for non-material explanations? Creationist statistician?

# Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 5) #

November 13, 2020

by Lars Johan Erkell

__Why is ID not seen as science?__

In this series of blog posts, I have repeatedly criticized Thorvaldsen and Hössjer for not working scientifically, and I have said that ID does not meet the requirements of science. ID proponents, by contrast, often and happily claim that they are victims of a rigid atheistic scientific (Darwinian) orthodoxy that refuses to recognize intelligent design as legitimate science. There may therefore be reason to very briefly review what actually characterizes established science.

Natural science strives to describe and explain physical reality. Explanations are limited to physical reality because that is the only one we have the tools to investigate. So there may well be a spiritual reality beyond our explanations; We cannot know anything about that. Many scientists are believers and do not experience a conflict between science and their faith in God. Natural science is thus agnostic and not atheistic.

The scientific way of working is usually called methodological naturalism - you then work with so-called natural explanations because that is the only thing that is practically possible, but one does not comment on what goes outside the method. There is another position called philosophical naturalism. It means that one excludes a priori all kinds of supernatural or spiritual forces, thus an atheistic position. But that is a logically untenable position – it is impossible to know that there cannot be things one does not know. I have never met a colleague who is a philosophical naturalist.

This distinction is rarely made among creationists and ID advocates, even though it should be obvious. Scientists are accused again and again of being "materialists" or "naturalists", by which they mean philosophical naturalists, i.e. atheists. But it is not true; science is, as I said, agnostic and not atheistic. There are believing scientists and there are atheist scientists.

But even though it is untrue that science would be hostile to religion, this is precisely a cornerstone of the ID project. More on this in the next post.

<div align="center">***</div>

Scientific work is based on explaining phenomena with the help of knowledge. The tides, for example, are explained by the gravitational force of the moon (and also the sun) affecting the sea water. We can measure, we can count, and we can confirm that the explanation matches reality.

Another example is population genetics. It is based on knowledge of genetic and molecular processes. With the help of population genetics, we can set up models of human evolution. Here, too, we can measure and count and evaluate our models. As we saw in the third post, Ola Hössjer and co-authors in their discussion of possible causes of genetic variation address five known factors: mutations, genetic drift, natural selection, recombination and colonization/isolation/migration. All of these are mechanisms that we know exist, and that we can measure and count on. We can have a fact-based discussion about how important the various factors are and how they work together. And we can get an idea of ​​how reasonable the conclusions are. This is science.

This is how you add an unknown designer as a sixth mechanism. Then all opportunities to conduct a fact-based discussion disappear; we have no idea when or how such a designer would intervene. Hössjer and his colleagues seem to assume that the designer would create just enough genetic variation that their model fits. How can they know that? How can they test their model? It's not possible. You have simply invented a designer that has the characteristics you desire.

As long as we stick to tangible and measurable factors, we know what we're talking about. If, on the other hand, we invoke an unknown designer, we do not know what we are talking about. This is exactly what makes ID not work as science. A designer explains everything and nothing<sup>1,2</sup>.

<div align="center">***</div>

Scientific theories say something about the world. Gravitational theory, again, says that the planets must move in elliptical orbits around the Sun and that they must not move in hexagonal orbits. This means that if someone comes up with a new physical theory that has as a consequence that the planets would move in hexagonal orbits, we can reject that theory. It does not match reality.

Intelligent design, however, says nothing about reality. Since we know nothing about the designer, anything is possible and nothing is off limits. There is no design theory or design model that says anything concrete about the world, so there is nothing to compare with reality. It cannot do that because such a model must be based on knowledge of the designer. And we don't have that.

Intelligent design has never been formulated as a concrete theory. The only thing ID can offer is a "theory" that says that since science cannot explain the world, there must be a designer who created it. The idea is old and well known. It is called the teleological proof of God.

However, this does not mean that you can reject the idea of a designer behind everything - there could be one. Science does not comment on what goes outside the scientific method. But the project to make ID a working science is stillborn.

__Comment by Ola Hössjer__

__Part 5: Intelligent Design and Science__

In the fifth part of his series of articles, Erkell turns to discussing scientific theory. This is welcome, because the biggest dividing line between me and Erkell concerns the philosophical starting point of science. Erkell writes the following:

"Natural science strives to describe and explain physical reality. Explanations are limited to physical reality because that is the only one we have the tools to investigate. So there may well be a spiritual reality beyond our explanations; We cannot know anything about that. Many scientists are believers and do not experience a conflict between science and their faith in God. Natural science is thus agnostic and not atheistic.

The scientific way of working is usually called methodological naturalism - you then work with so-called natural explanations because that is the only thing that is practically possible, but one does not comment on what goes outside the method. There is another position called philosophical naturalism. It means that one excludes a priori all kinds of supernatural or spiritual forces, thus an atheistic position. But that is a logically untenable position – it is impossible to know that there cannot be things one does not know. I have never met a colleague who is a philosophical naturalist.”

I fully agree with the distinction between methodological naturalism (allowing only natural explanations in natural science) and philosophical naturalism (excluding the existence of the supernatural), which I also discuss in my book "Becoming a Christian"<sup>12</sup>. Furthermore, I agree with Erkell that natural science strives to describe and explain physical reality. But then Erkell claims that natural explanations are the only explanations that are practically possible. How did he arrive at that? It is simply a secular belief that underlies Erkell's entire reasoning. Therefore, I believe that his claim that methodological naturalism is agnostic (implied objective) is completely wrong, because naturalism is also a belief.

To make it clear that methodological naturalism is based on a belief assumption, we can summarize this scientific theoretical working method in the context of the hypothetico-deductive method. We then get the following three steps:

1) Propose a falsifiable hypothesis that contains only natural explanations.
2) Evaluate and see if the hypothesis in 1) is consistent with the data.
3) If the agreement in 2) is not good, go back to 1) and propose a better hypothesis.

If, therefore, in step 1) one starts from the premise that only natural explanations are allowed, it is obvious that science will only deliver such explanations. As you shout in the forest, you get an answer. I therefore believe that methodological naturalism constitutes a completely unnecessary limitation of science, as it does not allow a number of falsifiable hypotheses (which are chosen based on criteria such as simplicity, round of explanations, relevance, etc.) with different philosophical starting points to be allowed to participate and compete on equal terms, so that the best possible model can be selected. Since science is about the search for truth, this is a very serious limitation of methodological naturalism. I treat this topic more extensively in two articles on secular science in the Scandinavian apologetic journal Theofilos<sup>13</sup>. Furthermore, in parts 2 and 3 of this article series, I have shown that it is perfectly possible to combine the hypothetico-deductive method with a design perspective or a creationist perspective.

After his initial discussion of methodological and philosophical naturalism, Erkell goes on to criticize creationists and ID proponents for not making this distinction:

"This distinction is rarely made among creationists and ID advocates, even though it should be crystal clear. Scientists are accused again and again of being "materialists" or "naturalists", by which they mean philosophical naturalists, i.e. atheists. But it is not true; science is, as I said, agnostic and not atheistic. There are believing scientists and there are atheistic scientists.”

This is another completely false claim, which makes the reader wonder how much ID and creationist literature Erkell has actually read. Philip Johnson's book "Darwin on Trial" formed an important part of the birth of the ID movement in the late 1980s. In this book, Johnson devotes an entire chapter to discussing the philosophical underpinnings of Darwinism. He then makes a distinction between naturalism and scientific naturalism, where the latter concept corresponds to methodological naturalism<sup>14</sup>. Stephen Meyer and other well-known ID advocates regularly touch on the philosophical starting points for the theory of evolution in their books and lectures, without claiming that evolutionary biologists must be atheists. More recently, the ID-inspired anthology "Theistic Evolution, A Scientific, Philosophical, and Theological Critique" was published, where I myself have contributed two articles. In as many as nine of the book's total of 31 chapters, the philosophical starting points for the theory of evolution are touched upon, with methodological naturalism as a central concept. Since the book is primarily written as a polemic against, and addressed to, Christians who have embraced both the theory of evolution and methodological naturalism, it is clear that the authors make a distinction between methodological and philosophical naturalism<sup>15</sup>. In Sweden, pretty much every issue of the creationist magazine Genesis touch on the secular starting points for the theory of evolution, without assuming that all followers of this theory need to be naturalists.

Erkell concludes Part 5 of his article series by commenting on why Intelligent Design is not science:

"Intelligent design, on the other hand, says nothing about reality. Since we know nothing about the designer, anything is possible and nothing is off limits. There is no design theory or design model that says anything concrete about the world, so there is nothing to compare with reality. It cannot do that because such a model must be based on knowledge of the designer. And we don't have that.”

I have already argued in parts 2 and 3 that this reasoning is incorrect, because I believe that it is perfectly possible to formulate falsifiable hypotheses that are inspired by the Bible or by a design perspective. But interestingly enough, evolutionary theory itself risks falling into the trap that everything is conceivable and nothing is forbidden (except that one must not violate the principle of methodological naturalism). For example, it is well known that the Darwinian explanation of genetic similarities between the organs of two species looks different depending on how closely related the species are considered to be. If the species are assumed to be closely related, the organ is considered to have originated in a common ancestor, to then be inherited, so-called homologous or orthologous organs. If, on the other hand, the species are not assumed to be closely related, the organs are considered to have developed independently of each other through convergent evolution, so-called analogous organs. In other words, the theory of evolution always has an explanation for observed similarity, which makes it difficult for it to fulfill one of the basic requirements of empirical science – falsifiability.

We fully agree on the distinction between methodological naturalism and philosophical naturalism, and that is excellent. But then you write:

"But then Erkell claims that natural explanations are the only explanations that are practically possible. How did he arrive at that? It is simply a secular belief that underlies Erkell's entire reasoning".

Yes, how have I come to the conclusion that the so-called natural explanations are the only ones that are practically possible to work with? For two reasons: the first is that natural science can only work with factors that can be clearly observed and that can be measured. It excludes supernatural powers that are not visible or measurable. The second reason is that, to my knowledge, no successful research program based on supernatural powers exists (correct me if I'm wrong - it would be interesting to be wrong on this point). So it is not some "secular assumption of faith" that is the basis of my reasoning. That is the reality.

You also write "Therefore, I believe that his claim that methodological naturalism is agnostic (implied objective) is completely wrong, because naturalism is also a belief". Two comments: to claim that agnostic naturalism would implicitly see itself as objective is completely backwards. Agnosticism is a position which means that one does not think one can make objectively correct judgments in matters of faith, and therefore abstains. Then I want to point out that (methodological) naturalism is not a belief, it is an epistemic position that does not exclude non-material explanations.

So you're wondering how much ID and creationist literature I've actually read. Far too much, is the answer. As for Phillip Johnson, I have published two posts about his book "Darwin on Trial" here on Biologg (https://biologg.wordpress.com/2011/12/08/fallet-darwin/ and https://biologg.wordpress. com/2011/12/14/creationism-and-naturalism/). However, he has a more detailed discussion of naturalism in the book "Reason in the Balance" from 1995. Here he derails already on the first page of the introduction:

"In our greatest universities, naturalism - the doctrine that nature is "all there is" - is the virtually unquestioned assumption that underlies not only natural science but intellectual work of all kinds." On the next page you read: "For professional purposes, atheistic and theistic biologists alike must assume that nature is all that is. Natural science is therefore based on naturalism. What a science based on naturalism tells us, not surprisingly, is that naturalism is true.”

This is not true. As I said, natural science is based on methodological naturalism, not on the philosophical naturalism Johnson writes about ("nature is all that is"). It is not assumed that nature is the only thing that exists, but that it is only practically possible to work with matter in its various forms. Of course, Johnson knows the difference, but in book after book he pushes the line that scientists make no difference between the two concepts, so really it's the same thing. Natural science would thus be governed by an atheistic ideology, which would exclude ID explanations in advance. This delusion is a fundamental element of the ID movement.

I have a little trouble understanding why intelligent and well-educated ID advocates constantly confuse methodological naturalism with philosophical naturalism, but I can think of two reasons. The first would be rooted in the fact that in practical research work it does not matter whether one is a methodological or a philosophical naturalist. Since there are no methods to study supernatural phenomena, those kinds of explanations are disregarded. A person of faith can then get the false impression that one completely denies supernatural powers, and that the two positions are actually the same - one would just use different pretexts to deny the reality of God. The second reason could be tactics in the debate around ID. By calling both positions "naturalism", even methodological naturalists can be made to appear as atheists who refuse to accept any form of supernatural forces and thus rule out ID from the start. You make them appear rigid and intolerant, which is a rhetorical gain.

So you write that "it is perfectly possible to formulate falsifiable hypotheses that are inspired by the Bible or by a design perspective". Of course it works, but what can you test with your hypotheses? I address that in the post "Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design" https://biologg.wordpress.com/2021/09/08/vetenskap-hypoteser-och-intelligent-design/.

Finally, you bring up the idea that the theory of evolution would not be falsifiable, since it contains two different mechanisms that can lead to life forms being similar. They may either be closely related to each other or they may have lived under similar selection pressures, which may cause them to evolve into similar forms. This was a problem for the system for a long time. Today, however, it is possible to establish kinship with genetic methods, which means that the mechanisms can be separated. If you now want to claim that a certain mechanism is the explanation for observed similarities, you have to provide convincing evidence that it is the correct one. And that reasoning must be falsifiable. You can't just go with one or the other, as you seem to think.

# Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 6) #

November 13, 2020

by Lars Johan Erkell

__Why was this article written?__

As I hope has become clear, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's article does not meet the requirements that one has the right to place on a scientific publication. It suggests results that do not exist. The article relies entirely on a statistical method to demonstrate designs that is unusable. It contains references to an indeterminate supernatural designer that resorts to ad hoc to achieve desired results. It introduces the completely revolutionary concept of "non-physical information" without definition or discussion. It contains a grossly garbled quote. In addition, well-known pseudoscientific concepts such as "irreducible complexity" and "specified complexity" are referred to as if they were established science. This cannot be called science. It can only be called pseudoscience.

Of course, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have received criticism. Three biologists write in a comment to the Journal of Theoretical Biology, among other things:

> ... The central claim of this paper is that because biological systems are complex then they must be fine-tuned. This inference is flawed and is not supported by the evidence.

Nor is the mathematician Jason Rosenhaus gracious in his criticism. He concludes thus:

> ... The authors claim to have used probability theory to establish a scientifically rigorous and useful notion of "fine-tuning," but they have failed because we have nothing like the information we would need to carry out meaningful probability calculations. Done.

But I don't think I've adequately communicated just how bad this paper is. The authors are constantly tossing out bits of mathematical jargon and notation, but then they do nothing with them. There is a frustrating lack of precision, as when they variously describe fine-tuning as an object, an entity, a method, and an attribute of a system, all on the first page of the paper. They constantly cite creationist references, with only the most glancing mention that any of this work has been strongly and cogently criticized. They say we should give fair consideration to a "design model" for the origin of complex structures, but they do not give the beginning of a clue as to what such a model entails.

In short, it's hard to believe this paper could have gotten through an honest peer-review process (as opposed to one in which ideology played a big role). Whatever happened behind the scenes, it's a huge black eye for the journal.

The review is worth reading in its entirety. It also covers things I didn't cover here.

<div align="center">***</div>

Steinar Thorvaldsen is professor of informatics at Norway's Arctic University in Tromsø and Ola Hössjer is professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University. They are both established professors at reputed universities. I find it hard to imagine that they would write papers of this poor quality in their own subjects (I also doubt they would get away with it). So why have they written this article? As experienced and competent researchers, they must reasonably be aware of the article's devastating scientific flaws. Why are they willing to risk name and reputation to write an article that makes me and many colleagues scratch their foreheads and wonder what has flown into the authors? This is not something you expect from a professor at a respected university.

My guess is that they see it as their task to spearhead a new kind of science that includes a designer, and that they feel is not limited by the materialism that characterizes established natural science. The idea of "Intelligent Design" as an alternative, non-materialistic science was launched in the USA in the 1990s by the conservative Christian think tank Discovery Institute. The institute's agenda was revealed in 1999 when the policy document The Wedge Document was leaked and posted on the Internet. It appears that they see "materialism" and moral relativism as the cause of all evil in society. Materialism must therefore be crushed:

> The Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its cultural legacies.

An important part of materialism is today's natural science, and therefore is an overarching goal

> To replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.

Design theory has been created to replace materialistic science:

> Design theory promises to reverse the stifling dominance of the materialist worldview, and to replace it with a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions.

The document shows very clearly that the ID project is a political/religious project; it is about working for a society that is completely imbued with a Christian religiosity. A state of God, in other words. Natural science is "materialistic" and therefore stands in the way. Therefore, it must be replaced by a religiously based design science.<sup>1</sup> Now, if any reader should think that I am presenting conspiracy theories, I would like to recommend a careful reading of the document.

This explains why they continue to pursue ID as a science even though the project is completely sterile - in more than 20 years they have not managed to produce a single solid result that concretely demonstrates design in nature. On the other hand, mountains of material have been produced that criticize established natural science in general and the theory of evolution in particular. The goal of the activity is not primarily to convince the researchers, it is to convince the public and decision-makers at various levels that design theory is better science than the established, materialistic, natural science. The document shows that the strategy is to defeat science in the political arena.

But what does all this have to do with Steinar Thorvaldsen and Ola Hössjer? It turns out that they are both connected to the Norwegian foundation BioCosmos, Thorvaldsen as chairman of the board and Hössjer as "ambassador". BioCosmos aims to spread intelligent design, primarily to youth and young adults, and are Norwegian partners of the Discovery Institute. Their article falls into the same pattern as countless other pro-ID articles: it is clearly written to give the impression that ID is a legitimate scientific theory, it contains no results, but many arguments against the theory of evolution.

Are Thorvaldsen and Hössjer aware that they are participating in a crusade against natural science? They should, as professional scientists, be aware that ID is a pseudo-scientific, indeed anti-scientific, project.

Whatever the case may be, it is sad that two such competent and meritorious researchers are unable to live up to the scientific integrity one has the right to expect from them.

__Part 6: Why was the fine-tuning article written?__

In part 6, Erkell goes further and asks what prompted me and Thorvaldsen to write the article on fine-tuning. I quote:

"Steinar Thorvaldsen is professor of informatics at Norway's Arctic University in Tromsø and Ola Hössjer is professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University. They are both established professors at reputed universities. I find it hard to imagine that they would write papers of this poor quality in their own subjects (I also doubt they would get away with it). So why have they written this article? As experienced and competent researchers, they must reasonably be aware of the article's devastating scientific flaws. Why are they willing to risk name and reputation to write an article that makes me and many colleagues scratch their foreheads and wonder what has flown into the authors? This is not something you expect from a professor at a respected university. My guess is that they see it as their task to spearhead a new kind of science that includes a designer, and that they feel is not limited by the materialism that characterizes established natural science.”

I have already in parts 1-5 responded to Erkell's claims that TH2020 is a pseudoscientific article of poor quality. Let me therefore answer Erkell's question why I have been involved in writing this and other articles with an ID-based or creationist focus. There are two main reasons. Firstly, I have belonged to the academic world since I started studying university mathematics at the age of 15. This time has given me an important education in how (empirical) science should be conducted. I advocate academic freedom, where all relevant theories are allowed to participate and compete on equal terms in providing the best explanation for the data, in the search for truth. For more than 20 years, I have studied genetics and evolutionary biology, and found that Darwin's theory of evolution contains crucial flaws that are rarely mentioned, neither in school nor in university. It is my duty as a scientist (part of the third task) to participate and spread such experiences I have acquired, both from my own research and by taking part in the research of others. My conscience therefore urges me to enter the debate about evolution and design, and this must come before political correctness.

Second, this is how all empirical science is based on assumptions of faith. All attempts to let only empirical data guide natural science (such as logical positivism) have failed. These beliefs become especially important in questions of origin, because we cannot replicate through repeated experiments how life arose, or how the diversity of life with different species arose. Therefore, every researcher who engages in origin issues will be more or less guided by their origin assumptions and beliefs. So do I. I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior and Lord, aged 23-24, and over the years have realized more and more how trustworthy and reliable the Bible is. I am therefore convinced that design-inspired or biblically inspired (and falsifiable) models provide the best explanation for genetic, geological and morphological data. But I don't want to force these explanations on others, but let ID and creationist models compete on the same terms as secular models. It is with sadness in my heart that I see how methodological naturalism has gradually narrowed (and forced) science into a secular direction since the 18th century. This has affected the entire development of society in a materialistic direction. Not least, the theory of evolution has had a decisive role in this process, because it constitutes the creation story of naturalism, and thus influences many other sciences. If neither God nor anything else supernatural exists, then everything must have arisen by itself, just as the theory of evolution claims. This is precisely why it is so sensitive to criticize the theory of evolution, of which Erkell's article series is a clear example. To criticize the theory of evolution is simply to question the worldview and foundations of a secular culture.

After Erkell's opening question about what prompted me and Thorvaldsen to write the fine-tuning article, he goes on to discuss the American ID think tank, the Discovery Institute, and its efforts to influence societal development away from materialism. The reason is that Thorvaldsens and I got involved in a Norwegian think tank that is positive about ID:

"But what does all this have to do with Steinar Thorvaldsen and Ola Hössjer? It turns out that they are both connected to the Norwegian foundation BioCosmos. Thorvaldsen as chairman of the board and Hössjer as "ambassador". BioCosmos aims to spread intelligent design, primarily to youth and young adults, and are Norwegian partners of the Discovery Institute. Their article falls into the same pattern as countless other pro-ID articles: it is clearly written to give the impression that ID is a legitimate scientific theory, it contains no results, but many arguments against the theory of evolution.

Are Thorvaldsen and Hössjer aware that they are participating in a crusade against natural science? They should, as professional scientists, be aware that ID is a pseudo-scientific, indeed anti-scientific, project.”

Since I have already argued that ID and creationism are science, I will not repeat my arguments in parts 1-5. I will content myself with stating that I neither consider TH2020 to be an example of pseudo-science or anti-science. But still, Erkell's claims are not surprising, since he so strongly advocates methodological naturalism, that is, secular science. From Erkell's horizon, therefore, a crusade against natural science is the same as a crusade against secular natural science. As I wrote in this article, I believe that biblically inspired explanations and design-inspired explanations have much better conditions than the secular models. But since I don't want to force others to take this approach, it's hardly a case of a crusade. One can rather ask the question whether Erkell is waging a crusade against all science that does not start from methodological naturalism.

In this post, I discuss the motivations of the article authors. In your reply, you write: "For more than 20 years, I have studied genetics and evolutionary biology, and found that Darwin's theory of development contains crucial flaws that are rarely mentioned, neither in school nor at university." From what you write, I suspect that you got your knowledge from creationist contexts rather than from university courses. The formulation of "crucial flaws rarely mentioned" is a classic creationist theme. But there is no science that is complete or perfect; there are gaps and "critical deficiencies" in all subjects. However, creationists are most interested in the flaws they see in evolutionary biology. This fact that the flaws are "rarely mentioned" and your talk of "political correctness" also connects to a well-known creationist theme: the atheist scientists who completely dominate science and try to stifle all opposition to the theory of evolution.

This with the third task, you have probably been put on the back foot. The university pays you to present the science and scientific view that the university stands for, not for you to present a scientific view (and a view of evolutionary biology) that the university does not stand for. As a researcher, you certainly have a lot of freedom to choose different perspectives, but I think you are probably crossing the line here.

So you write that "It is with sadness in my heart that I see how methodological naturalism has gradually narrowed (and forced) science into a secular direction since the 18th century", and here I think we have come to the core of the poodle. You see an ideological struggle between two cultures, one secular and the other spiritual. I, on the other hand, see a successful, secular, research program replacing a sterile, spiritual, program. Materialistic research has gradually replaced research on a non-materialistic basis because it actually works and produces results. I have never seen any example of successful natural science on a spiritual/religious basis.

But as I write in the seventh post in the series, I could imagine an ID-inspired research if it produced concrete results. But we are not there. All you can offer are assurances that an ID-inspired research will open up new advances by freeing science from materialistic lock-ins. However, I can't see any signs that this could be the case. I discuss this further in the post "Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design".

You avoid perhaps the most serious part of my criticism, namely that the ID project is fundamentally not about science but a political/religious project aimed at building a society completely imbued with Christian religiosity - a god state. Do you have any comment on that?

# Breakthrough for Intelligent design? (part 7) #

November 13, 2020

by Lars Johan Erkell

__Why was the article published?__

The publication of Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's article is quite embarrassing for the Journal of Theoretical Biology. One could expect the journal to take drastic measures to try to restore its damaged reputation. Like withdrawing the article, firing the responsible editor and blacklisting the reviewers who were responsible for the scientific review. But they didn't do that.

Instead, they let the article stand and published a disclaimer, a dissociation, from the journal's management. It reads:

> The Journal of Theoretical Biology and its co-Chief Editors do not endorse in any way the ideology of nor reasoning behind the concept of intelligent design. Since the publication of the paper it has now become evident that the authors are connected to a creationist group (although their addresses are given on the paper as departments in bona fide universities). We were unaware of this fact while the paper was being reviewed. Moreover, the keywords "intelligent design" were added by the authors after the review process during the proofing stage and we were unaware of this action by the authors. We have removed these from the online version of this paper. We believe that intelligent design is not in any way a suitable topic for the Journal of Theoretical Biology.

Here they distance themselves from ID as such, and they say that they did not understand that it was about ID because the keyword "intelligent design" was added by the authors only after the article had been reviewed. That is a strange statement. Firstly, because people would not have understood that it was about ID. It is enough to glance quickly through the text to recognize familiar ID themes such as irreducible complexity, specified complexity or Dembski's explanation filter. If you happen to not recognize such markers, you should ask yourself what in the world this is all about, and look it up. To not spot that this is about creationism/ID shows ignorance and carelessness on a level that is inexcusable for a scientific journal.

Secondly, I believe that it is wrong to reject an article solely for the reason that it deals with ID. It could (purely theoretically) happen that someone actually managed to find good scientific arguments for ID, and then they should of course be published. It would be a sensation. But, as we saw in the previous post, Thorvaldsen and Hössjer have not managed to show anything at all. The statistical method they want to launch is useless, and consequently they have no results. The article should not have been accepted for publication for the reason that it has no scientific interest. Added to this is all the pseudoscience the article contains.

So why didn't the journal retract the article, and why did they write this strange disclaimer? One reason may be that the publisher that owns the Journal of Theoretical Biology, Elsevier, had bad experiences with retracting articles related to ID. A well-known ID proponent, the mathematician Granville Sewell, had an article in 2011 titled “A second look at the second law” accepted by Applied Mathematical Letters, also owned by Elsevier. When the editor realized that the work was pseudoscientific, it was retracted. Sewell sued the magazine, and the affair ended with the publisher being forced to pay $10,000 and also publish an apology. You probably don't want to do this again.

But how did Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's article even get through the review process? One possibility is, as I said, ignorance and carelessness on a level that is unforgivable for a scientific journal. Another could be that the authors may have taken advantage of the opportunity that some journals offer, to suggest suitable reviewers themselves. If they then suggested ID-friendly people, and the editor didn't bother to read the work, the article may have gone under the radar. Then the editor himself may have been ID-friendly.

Whatever the reason for this handling may be, it is sad that such a highly ranked journal as the Journal of Theoretical Biology is unable to live up to basic requirements of scientific integrity.

<div align="center">***</div>

Finally, what will be the answer to the question if Thorvaldsen and Hössjer's article is a breakthrough for Intelligent Design? It depends on who you ask. For the Discovery Institute and the ID movement, it is a success to have received an ID-friendly article in a high-ranking scientific journal. The publication makes it easier to present ID as a scientifically legitimate theory, something that is valuable in public opinion work. At the same time, the journal's disclaimer provides an opportunity to present the ID movement as a victim and complain that you are being discriminated against by the "Darwinists". They go so far as to compare the magazine's treatment of the article to the Nazis' treatment of the Jews. The Swedish association Genesis sees the deal as a serious attack on its academic freedom and illustrates his article with an image that appears to come from a concentration camp.

From a scientific point of view, the article does not represent a scientific breakthrough for the simple reason that it contains no results. Just a useless statistical model. And that makes perfect sense; ID is not a scientific project, and it cannot produce any scientific knowledge.

__Part 7: Why was the fine-tuning article published?__

In the last and concluding part of his article series, Erkell asks himself how our article could be accepted by a reputable journal. I find no reason to comment on Erkell's speculation about the reason TH2020 was published. I am content to state that the article was reviewed according to the usual peer review procedure.

After pondering the reasons why TH2020 was published, Erkell arrives at the following conclusion:

"Whatever the reason for this handling may be, it is sad that such a highly ranked journal as the Journal of Theoretical Biology is unable to live up to basic requirements for scientific integrity."

Here one can ask what the basic requirements for scientific integrity are? Based on Erkell's first six articles, it is not difficult to guess that for him scientific integrity means that science must follow methodological naturalism as a principle. In other words, Erkell demands that all science be conducted with secular signs. For my part, on the contrary, I believe that the editors showed a great deal of integrity when, despite a storm of criticism from evolutionary biologists, they stuck to their decision to publish the article. As I see it, this is a healthy sign for science that gives good hope for the future.

__Conclusions from parts 1-7__

In summary, I welcome analysis of the research articles I have written, both those that contain constructive criticism and appreciation. In this context, I would like to take the opportunity to mention that not all scientists seem to have the same attitude towards mine and Thorvaldsen's article as Erkell. After TH2020 was published, I co-authored a follow-up article on waiting times to effect major genetic changes. This paper has recently been published and I have been invited to give a talk on its findings at an international conference with many well-known participants.

As I wrote in the introduction, I want to thank Lars Johan Erkell for actually taking the time to read, not only mine and Steinar's article on fine-tuning, but also several of the articles we refer to. As time permits, I am happy to continue this exchange of ideas, through articles or debates. However, I believe that much of Erkell's criticism misses the mark. First, Erkell has misunderstood what Intelligent Design or creationism means by assuming that such research is governed by non-falsifiable criteria. Secondly, Erkell makes a feather out of a chicken when he criticizes us for using the word "non-physical information", because he did not understand what we mean by this term. Third, Erkell does not seem to realize that his methodological naturalism is not an objective and agnostic point of view, but on the contrary is based on a materialist belief. By using methodological naturalism, Erkell thus wants to force all research to be guided by secular assumptions. For my part, I advocate a scientific environment where secular, design-based, creationist and other hypotheses are allowed to participate and compete on equal terms. I leave it to the reader to judge whether my approach or Erkell's is the most democratic and best matches the purpose of science to seek the truth.

Finally, to the question of how TH2020 came to be published in J Theol Biol. I, and many with me, have been surprised by the matter. You write above that the article has been reviewed "according to the usual peer review procedure". The picture you get of the process in the article "Creation-based research moves the positions forward", which the association Genesis published on its website on July 9 , is a completely different one:

"During the review process, the journal's editors and reviewer advised the authors to tone down the references to Intelligent Design (ID) and replace it with the term 'fine-tuning', including in the title of the article, which was done. On the other hand, there were no objections to a discussion of ID, as well as criticism of neo-Darwinism, on the condition that Thorvaldsen and Hössjer also referred to ID-critical sources. For that reason, the authors judged in connection with the final revision that it would be relevant to have "intelligent design" as one of the keywords for the article. The word "Intelligent" was then deleted by the responsible editor (see below); the word 'intelligent' is still considered too sensitive in contexts like this."

Here we got the explanation why the article could be published: ID-friendly editors. That the journal's editors and assessors advise the authors to avoid sensitive phrases in order to go under the radar and thus be able to violate the journal's policy is not a "customary" procedure. It is also confirmed by the disclaimer that was published. Your claim that this was a "customary peer review procedure" is therefore not true, if the article on the website of the association Genesis is to be believed. I am inclined to do so.

So to my regret that the journal does not live up to basic requirements for scientific integrity. You write "Based on Erkell's first six articles, it is not difficult to guess that for him scientific integrity means that science must follow methodological naturalism as a principle". No, this has nothing to do with naturalism. It is about the fact that a scientific journal should not publish material that does not meet reasonable requirements for scientific rigor, thereby giving it legitimacy. For me, this means in this case that you don't publish material where you:

  - claim that you have shown something when you have not actually done it. The reader who is not attentive (or knowledgeable enough) is deceived.
  - present an unusable method as if it were useful. Again, you can fool the reader.
  - give the impression that concepts that are not established and well defined, such as "specificity" and "non-physical information" would actually be solid and defined. This means that reasoning can give the impression of being rigorous when in fact the concepts are so blurred that they do not make sense.
  - do not discuss weaknesses in your own model. The most glaring weakness in this case is the enormous (and by all accounts insurmountable) difficulties in calculating the probability that a structure would be designed by a non-material designer, something that is not mentioned.
  - have falsified quotations in the text.

In conclusion, you suggest that much of my criticism misses the mark for three reasons:

"Firstly, Erkell has misunderstood what Intelligent Design or creationism means, in that he assumes that such research is governed by non-falsifiable criteria". To that I answer both yes and no. I make an attempt to clarify the problem in the post "Science, hypotheses and Intelligent design"

"Secondly, Erkell makes a chicken out of a feather when he criticizes us for using the word "non-physical information", because he did not understand what we mean by this concept". It is quite true that I do not understand what you mean by "non-physical information". And that is because you yourselves do not seem to understand what you mean - you do not even attempt a definition. The only thing you come up with is a vague reference to "semantic information".

"Thirdly, Erkell does not seem to realize that his methodological naturalism is not an objective and agnostic point of view, but on the contrary is based on a materialist belief. By using methodological naturalism, Erkell wants to force all research to be guided by secular assumptions". This is an echo of Phillip Johnson's argument that methodological naturalism is in fact philosophical naturalism in disguise. It's not like that. Methodological naturalism is precisely methodological, it is about how to work in a purely practical way to obtain reliable research results. But ID research (to the extent that it exists at all) has not produced a single concrete result in more than 20 years (please correct me if I'm wrong). This is because they could not find any practically feasible methods for "design detection" - all they have is reasoning about how it could be done. TH2020 is another example of that thing. And because ID research does not work in practice, it is not seen as scientifically interesting.

So to democracy. You and Steinar Thorvaldsen have published an article here that openly argues for ID in J. Theor. Biol., an established scientific journal. You obviously have full freedom to devote yourself to ID within the framework of your professorships. The same goes for your fellow professors Michael Behe, Stuart Burgess and Scott Minnich, to mention three names that come to mind at the moment. So of course it is permissible to work with ID, and it is possible to publish in the scientific press. But of course you have difficulty getting research grants, and that's not so strange - a completely ordinary, secular, research program that hasn't produced any results for more than 20 years wouldn't get a penny either.

You write that you are happy to continue our exchange of ideas through articles or debates. It was fun, I do too, but I'm not particularly interested in debates. A written exchange with well-thought-out lines, like the one we have now, gives much more. And these are important questions we have to address: what is legitimate science, and where are the limits of science?
