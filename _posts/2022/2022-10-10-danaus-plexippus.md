<figcaption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly"><i>Danaus plexippus</i></a> &ndash; monarch butterfly larvae.  The photographer writes, "The next generation of monarchs. I saw 5 on the milkweed this AM. I bought plants originally but this spring the seeds from the plants germinated & I have little milkweeds in various places.  I am picking off some of the pods and placing them in places I hope they will come up next year." We hope so too!
