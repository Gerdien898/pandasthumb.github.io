A recent meme widely spread on the internet shows Worst Science Stock Photos.  It seems to have originated with Dr. Kit Chapman of the University of Falmouth, U.K., who posted candidates for worst on his 
[Twiiter account](https://twitter.com/ChemistryKit) and conducted a vote.  The two above were among these (the left one was #2 in the voting).  They are 
shown because they are my favorites.  #1 was an image showing a model holding a soldering iron by its hot tip and soldering on the wrong side of a circuit board.

Another place the stock photos will be found is at
Peaceful Science in a recent thread. To see discussion
