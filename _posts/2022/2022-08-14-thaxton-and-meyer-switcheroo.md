An article at the Discovery Institute's
website Evolution News [__reprints a tribute__](https://evolutionnews.org/2022/08/from-intelligent-cause-to-intelligent-design-my-debt-to-charles-thaxton/)
that Stephen Meyer paid to Charles Thaxton,
in a preface Meyer wrote to a memoir
by Thaxton.

Um, different question!

The "information stored in the DNA molecule" is of course the precise sequence of bases.  Not the existence of the molecule
in the first place.  And there are well-known evolutionary processes that are capable of putting adaptive information into
the molecule by choosing particular bases at each site.  They continue to happen long after the origin of life.

Let me explain:

<!--more-->

It is very much like someone saying that to explain the information stored in some computer memory, what we have to discuss
is how the computer came to exist.  No, we don't.

If we compare a novel by Leo Tolstoy to a set of short stories by Anton Chekhov, what is of interest is not how books
came to be invented, or how the particular binding, fonts, and physical format were chosen.  The two works might be
very much the same in those respects, but they of course will be very different in the sequence of letters in the
books.  And that is where the information is that makes them different, and makes both of them remarkable.  In the
photo above we see Chekhov(L) with Tolstoy(R), when Tolstoy visited Chekhov's dacha in 1900.  The two authors 
had much to discuss about their writings, and those of others.  But I doubt they spent much of that time discussing 
how and where books first arose.

Most of Meyer's piece concentrates on the origin of life, and does not at all discuss how the information in the 
DNA got there.  Why does Meyer insist on describing that as the issue? Is there some big mystery?  Are the ordinary processes of evolution, such as natural selection and 
mutation somehow incapable, in principle, of putting into the DNA information that leads to the organism being well-adapted? 

Differences in the sequences in DNA (or RNA) genomes can lead to differences in phenotype.  And those differences in 
phenotype can lead to differences in function, and thus differences in fitness.  The sequences with higher fitness will 
tend to increase in frequency.  The genotypes in the population come to be better adapted.  When we use the scale of 
fitness as a specification, the functional information in the genome then increases.  There is no mystery as to how 
this can happen, no proof that improved adaptation is somehow impossible in principle.

## Misunderstanding or misdirection? ##

Advocates of ID and creationists often avoid talking about how changes of DNA sequence by mutation and by changes of 
gene frequency of the resulting DNA sequences increase the functional information in the DNA.  They usually immediately 
change the subject to the Origin Of Life.  I like to call this change of topic OTOOL (Off To the Origin Of Life), or
STOOL (Switch To the Origin Of Life).  It is moving to a much-less-well-understood topic, one where Design Intervention 
can be invoked.  


They often say that they do not question the processes of "microevolution", including mutation, natural selection, 
gene flow, and genetic drift.  Yet these processes can easily be shown to put functional information into the pool of 
genomes.

That's what Stephen Meyer does in the Preface to Thaxton's book, the one quoted in his piece in Evolution News.  It's the 
old switcheroo once again.  When Meyer raises the issue of how the information comes to be in the DNA, he immediately does the
old familiar change-of-topic.  If he does not mean to deliberately switch the topic, then he is giving a strong indication 
that he simply does not understand what the functional information in DNA is.


## In the echo chamber ##

Of course, as usual,
at Uncommon Descent, the Meyer/Thaxton article is
[__taken very seriously__](https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-evolution-news-from-intelligent-cause-to-intelligent-design-my-debt-to-charles-thaxton/), and quoted at length, with no
recognition that the origin of the information in
the DNA might be a different issue from the origin of the first DNA molecule.  The post is authored by "Caspian", who the
site identifies as its regular poster, physicist Eric Hedin.  He ought to have a good grasp of
information theory.  Is it too much 
to ask whether the site might someday distinguish between these two questions?  Apparently so.
