  Now that most molecular biologist and genomicists have concluded (erroneously) that the notion of "junk DNA" was a mistake, 
  here comes the Institute for Creation Research to crow about how wrong the scientists were and how the real science shows that humans are descended 
  from Adam and Eve only thousands of years ago.  Above you will find the ICR video (click on the link in the caption, the figure is only

  by Daniel Stern Cardinale. See below ... </p>
