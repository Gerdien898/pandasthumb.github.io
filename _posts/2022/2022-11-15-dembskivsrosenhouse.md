Jason Rosenhouse's recent book [The Failures of Mathematical Anti-evolutionism]() drew a lengthy, and sharply dismissive, review from William Dembski
([here]()).  That in turn drew a lengthy, and sharply dismissive reply [here at Panda's Thumb]() by Jason Rosenhouse.  Rosenhouse:

> It is a person of rare talent who can write at such length without getting anything right.

Dembski, after telling a story of a judge who committed a woman to a mental institution after hearing her say palpably insane things:

> As you read Rosenhouse’s reply, your reaction ought to be that of the judge. If it isn’t, you should consider (but of course won’t) whether Darwinism has addled your brain.

In general, I'll leave the Rosenhouse-vs.-Dembski debate to them, as they are not short of detailed arguments.  But one topic has always intrigued me, and it seems to 
be central to Dembski's concerns.  And that is the use of arguments involving Specified Complexity to diagnose Design Intervention.  Let's look at what Dembski says about 
it, and then what Rosenhouse says about that.
