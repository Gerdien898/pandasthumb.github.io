<p>It is interesting that, as of Wednesday (July 13) late afternoon, that Answers 
in Genesis has posted nothing about the spectacular preliminary results from the James Webb 
Space Telescope (JWST) released the previous day. Most people probably missed it, but AiG 
has responded in a very poor way, on their Facebook and possibly other social media. On 
Tuesday, July 12 on AiG’s and Ken Ham’s Facebook pages, there was a simulcast of the NASA 
press conference where the first photos and results from the JWST were shown. Here is the link to the Ham Facebook post of the simulcast video: 
﻿<a href="https://fb.watch/ee25qVAHqq/?mibextid=qZdngE&amp;fs=e&amp;s=cl">https://fb.watch/ee25qVAHqq/?mibextid=qZdngE&amp;fs=e&amp;s=cl</a>.
I don’t know if you have to have a Facebook account to view this.  (It is also available on Youtube
<a href="https://youtu.be/od6829WF-S4">here</a>).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Their response was by AiG’s astronomer, Dr. Danny Faulkner, and their “rocket scientist,” Rob 
Webb. Their discussion was a rather weak critique of the JWST’s findings and funny and sad at the same 
time. Through most of their simulcast, one couldn’t hear what the NASA people were saying, but this 
may have been a technical difficulty. About 23 minutes in Dr. Faulkner and Webb bizarrely claim that 
light year distances don’t necessarily equal long time scales (thus not refuting a 6,000 year old 
universe). Soon after, Dr. Faulkner states his “theory” (not a scientific theory, but he doesn’t seem 
to know this) that we can see things billions of light years away in a 6,000 year old universe because 
of a “miracle.” His position is literally “then a miracle occurred.” This is reminiscent of the famous 
Sidney Harris cartoon found <a href="http://www.sciencecartoonsplus.com/pages/gallery.php">here:</a>. Dr. Faulkner 
goes on to say that Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden saw pretty much what we see today when 
looking at the night sky.</p>

UPDATE: July 8, 2022.  David Klinghoffer has now <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/rosenhouse-roundup/">posted a link</a> to my reply to William Dembski's review of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Failures-Mathematical-Anti-Evolutionism-Jason-Rosenhouse/dp/1108820441/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26C2DNOQ4ZV60&amp;keywords=rosenhouse&amp;qid=1657328451&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=%2Cstripbooks%2C89&amp;sr=1-1">my book</a>.  He even encourages people to buy the book.  Thanks!   
</p>
<p>
On July 5, at 4:09 pm, Eastern time, I received the following email from the Discovery Institute's David Klinghoffer:
<blockquote>
Dear Jason,

Your new book caught the attention of my Discovery Institute colleague Bill Dembski. We have been publishing his review of it serially at Evolution News, which I edit. Now that that’s done, as your time permits, I wanted to cordially invite you to respond to his review in the same forum, at whatever length you think is appropriate, without editorial interference. Since Dembski’s work is covered and critiqued extensively in your book, as he notes, I hope you will accept the offer, while giving me a reply to the invitation that I can share with our readers, whom I’ve alerted about this prospect for dialogue.

I look forward to hearing from you.

David
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Normally I would not publish a private email without the sender's permission, but in this case I think it's OK to do so.  You see, Klinghoffer was so pleased with this email that he posted it himself at the <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/07/invitation-to-jason-rosenhouse-respond-to-dembski/">Discovery Institute's blog.</a>  The title of the post was: Invitation to Jason Rosenhouse: Respond to Dembski.  He concluded the post with, "Now let's find out what he will say."
</p>
<p>
At 4:17 pm, just eight minutes later, I sent the following reply to Klinghoffer:
<blockquote>
Hi David.  Thank you for the invitation.  I have recently posted <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/07/Dembski-response.html">a reply to Dembski</a> at the Panda's Thumb.  I intend for that to be my last word on the subject.
  
Jason
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
As I write this, close to two days have passed, but Klinghoffer has not updated his original post to let his readers know that I had replied to Dembski.  Nor did he post something new indicating that I had done so.  One minute he's looking forward to hearing from me and musing about the prospects for dialogue, but the next it's crickets.
  </p>
<p>
  It's almost as if he didn't <em>really</em> want to have an exchange of ideas, but was instead just preening for his readers. He now knows "what he will say", but seems afraid to let his readers in on it.  Why do you suppose that is?

One can always count on the ID/creationist website Uncommon Descent for oddities.  Yesterday they noticed a post here: Timothy Sandefur's
discussion of the legal issues raised by the rightward move of the U.S. Supreme Court, and the legal theories the court majority used 
to address separation of church and state.  And how the court might now rule on a case like the Dover School Board case.  (Tim's post 
is of course, found <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/religious-conservatism-on-the-Supreme-Court.html">here</a>).
  </p>
<p>
 The UD post <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-pandas-thumb-worry-that-the-u-s-supreme-court-will-rule-for-creationism/">(here)</a> is 
 signed by their official reporter "News", who seems these days to be physicist Eric Hedin. They first quote a paragraph from Sandefur's post 
 about the flaws in the legal theory of "originalism" used by the Supreme Court majority.  Then
they close in for the kill, saying:
<blockquote>For some, tormenting themselves with this stuff probably seems to make more sense than confronting the fact that 
Darwinism (which is generally what they mean by “evolution”) isn’t as widely believed as it used to be within biology. Never 
mind what a judge thinks should be taught to kids in school.</blockquote>
<p>
They follow this with a paragraph from the Discovery Institute site <em>Mind Matters</em> touting a science commentary article from 
<em>The Guardian</em> which advocates the renaming of the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis because it has been incorporating 
too many new phenonmena.

William Dembski has now reviewed my new book <em>The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism</em>.  His review comes to roughly 18000 words.  According to at least one standard classification scheme, that makes it a novella.  The full review can be found <a href="https://billdembski.com/intelligent-design/success-of-mathematics-in-advancing-intelligent-design/">here</a>.  It is also appearing in sections at the Discovery Institute's site Evolution News (see <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/author/wdembski/">here</a>).
<p>
It is a person of rare talent who can write at such length without getting anything right.  Dembski’s response consists mostly of lengthy, irrelevant digressions that have little to do with anything I actually wrote, out-of-context sentences and sentence fragments from my book that seem specifically intended to mislead his readers about my arguments, and his usual arrogance and self-puffery about his own brilliance.  He obsesses over minor comments I include in a chapter’s endnotes, while ignoring the main argument I made in the chapter itself.  When he does get around to responding to an argument, he seems in most cases not even to understand the point I was making.  Frankly, I could easily have written a more cogent reply to my own book.
<p>
I will only respond to what I regard as the most important points and will simply ignore large swaths of his review.  To anything that I do not specifically address, you can assume my response is to roll my eyes and say, “Whatever.  Let him blather.”
