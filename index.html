<p>I have been using the Kentucky Open Records Act (KORA) for several years to keep up with attempts by creationists to infiltrate schools, receive tax incentives for the Ark Encounter theme park, and monitor attendance levels at the Ark Encounter. Usually, government entities have been cooperative with my efforts. The public, after all, should have the right to know how the government, at all levels, conducts its business. Alas, the Kentucky Attorney General has protected himself from public scrutiny.</p>

<p>On September 8, 2021, Kentucky Attorney General (AG) Daniel Cameron visited the Ark Encounter near Williamstown, Kentucky. On September 12, 2021, a brief, <a href="https://twitter.com/kyoag/status/1437026455171575813">professionally done video of his visit</a> was posted to the Kentucky Attorney General’s official state Twitter page (this is not a political campaign site, but an official Commonwealth of Kentucky account for the AG’s Office) . The video ends by displaying a <a href="https://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx">link to the AG’s website</a>.</p>

<p>The video shows that the AG and his entourage received a personal tour from Ken Ham, even viewing the quasi-spectacular vista on the upper deck where tourists generally are not allowed. Interestingly, there isn’t any audio of Cameron or Ham, just quick edit clips of Ham leading a tour set to music. It is difficult to imagine anything helpful or informative to Kentuckians about the video, and it appears to be nothing more the AG pandering to the most conservative Kentucky voters.</p>

        <p><em>I was hoping to write this post a week ago, but war intervened,
and I spent much of the time since then watching news about
the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the incredible courage
of large numbers of Ukrainians who are resisting it, and the
incredible courage of those Russians who are protesting their
government’s aggression. This post takes a short break from
that.</em></p>

<p>Two months ago, an article in <em>Nature</em> argued, from observations
on the plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> that mutation is not
random.  This was the occasion for loud declarations from
creationists and ID advocates that the foundations of the
Modern Synthesis had been undermined.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Here is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04269-6">the <em>Nature</em> paper, which is open access</a></li>
  <li>and here are the responses <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/02/new-study-in-nature-showing-non-random-mutation-spells-trouble-for-neo-darwinism/">at the Discovery Institute’s site <em>Evolution News and Science Today</em></a></li>
  <li>and similar <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/are-mutations-really-random/">commentary from the “peanut gallery”</a> at Uncommon Descent</li>
  <li>and a (short) <a href="https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/mutation-bias-reflects-natural-selection-in-arabidopsis-thaliana/14724">thread at Josh Swamidass’s site Peaceful Science</a></li>
</ul>

<p>What I would like to ask is, whether modern evolutionary theory,
rests on the assumption that mutation is “random”.  And if so,
in what sense does it need to be random for the theory to be
tenable?  I’ll make some suggestions below, but they are 
tentative, and your thoughts are welcome.</p>

        <p>On Valentine’s Day of this year, the <a href="https://www.amnat.org/announcements/named-awards.html">American Society of Naturalists</a> announced that it was removing individuals’ names from its awards.  Since some of us were concerned about what might lie behind this, I wrote to the Society’s Secretary, <a href="https://www.mcglothlin.biol.vt.edu/">Professor Joel McGlothlin</a>, asking for clarification.</p>

<p>Our worst fears were confirmed.  We have witnessed an act of preemptive cowardice by the ASN Executive Council, much of value has been lost, and a valuable educational opportunity has been wasted. However, the changes will not take effect until this year’s awards are made.  In the meantime, I would strongly urge all members of the Society who read this, and in particular all awardees, to contact the Society through the Secretary, Professor Joel McGlothlin, at joelmcg@vt.edu, and make their views known.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amnat.org/awards.html">awards affected</a> are the Sewall Wright Award, the E.O. Wilson Naturalist Award, the Jasper Loftus-Hills Young Investigator Award, the Ruth Patrick Student Poster Award, the Julia Platt Postdoc Presentation Award, and the Ed Ricketts Student Presentation Award.</p>

<p>Of these, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright">Sewall Wright</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson">E.O. Wilson</a> need no introduction from me. <a href="https://www.amnat.org/awards.html#Jasper">Jasper Loftus-Hills</a> was an Australian biologist of exceptional promise, killed by a hit and run driver when he was conducting fieldwork, just three years after receiving his PhD. Among numerous other achievements, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Patrick">Ruth Patrick</a> established the Department of Limnology at the National Academy of Sciences, and did pioneering work on freshwater biodiversity and how it is impacted by pollution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Platt">Julia Platt</a> was the first to establish the neural crest origin of the cranium, was not able (this was in the 1890s) to obtain a PhD or an academic position in the U.S., went into politics and used her political role to establish one of the earliest marine conservation areas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Ricketts">Ed Ricketts</a> pioneered the study of intertidal ecology, and collaborated with the novelist John Steinbeck.  These are the people whose names the American Society of Naturalists no longer wishes to see prominently attached to their awards.</p>

<p>A geranium plant that I supposedly take care of has a serious infestation with whiteflies. Before dousing the plant with insecticidal soap (a procedure I am supposed to follow every week for a while), I snapped the preceding picture. There is a lot of there there, so I asked Mark Sturtevant exactly what I am looking at. His response:</p>

<blockquote><p>The spiky things are a weird part of the life cycle of whiteflies. Although they are in the order Hemiptera, which are 'supposed' to have <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/incomplete-metamorphosis/">incomplete metamorphosis</a> (passing thru nymphal stages before molting into adults), whiteflies are hemipterans that essentially have a larval stage and pupal stage of <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/complete-metamorphosis/">holometabolous</a> insects.</p>

<p>You can see quite a bit going on here in this one picture. I have re-attached your picture with some annotations.</p> 

<p>I don't know if there are eggs in view. The tiny white specks look more like glandular secretions from the leaf. But there are a few larvae along the top border of the picture, and I have marked some with an L.  You see the pupal stage already (one is marked with a P), but technically these are <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/puparium/">puparia</a>. When a larva becomes a pupa, the larva usually sheds its cuticle to show the pupa underneath, with its own cuticle. But in whiteflies (and in some other insects like flies and fleas), the larva does not shed its cuticle. Rather, it puffs it out, hardens it, and the pupal stage stays locked inside the larval cuticle. That outer larval shell is called the puparium. Then there are the adults. The large adults are females, and I have marked one with an F. Males are smaller and much more active. Winged males fly and seek out females. I think the one labelled M is a male.</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the day was warm, and there were lots of males on the window trying to get out.</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Sturtevant about the transparent spheres that clutter the frame:</p>

<blockquote>I don't know what the big spheres are, but it could be like aphids (whiteflies are related to them) which periodically secrete a drop of honeydew. This is excess water from plant sap, and aphids secrete that to concentrate the nutrients. Since whiteflies are always secreting a waxy bloom, a thin wax coating on their honeydew droplets would hold them together. That's a hypothesis, but I don't really know. </blockquote>
