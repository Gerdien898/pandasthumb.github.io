<p>

The most powerful evidence in favor of common descent is what’s called the nested hierarchy of life. Other scientists may have their own candidates for most powerful evidence, and might say that the most powerful evidence comes from within their fields. A paleontologist might point to the fossil record. But I’m a phylogeneticist and I’m writing this, so nested hierarchy it is. Also, since I work with molecular data, I’m going to talk most often about DNA sequences. But what I say applies to all sorts of other data too: proteins, anatomy, behavior, whatever heritable features an organism has.
<p>

 "Nested hierarchy”, stated most simply, means that species can be organized into a branching tree: species at the ends of the twigs, meeting in branches, that themselves meet other branches, and finally coming down to a meeting of all branches at the root of the tree. Further, the tree represents the actual pattern of branching descent, with each joining of branches representing the common ancestor of all the species above it.
<p>

But of course the tree diagram itself is evidence of nothing; you can draw a tree for any combination of species, and in fact you can draw any number of different trees connected in different ways for the same combination. What makes the tree evidence is that you use data to determine the tree, lots of data, and that different samples of data consistently determine a particular tree rather than a bunch of wildly different ones. For example, consider a very simple tree of four species: human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. How do we know those species are related by common descent? There are fifteen possible ways to arrange these four species into a tree, and the one supported by most evidence is tree #1 in the figure above.
<p>

We also need some way to decide which tree the data fit. I’m going to use a very simple criterion, parsimony. Other criteria are more complex, but the way they are used is the same. Under parsimony, the tree that most simply accounts for the similarities and differences among the species is the one that fits. Consider, for example, the two characteristics (characters, for short) shown in the figure above, character #1 in blue and character #2 in red. Each of them has two possible values, or states, that we name A and B. In the tree at left, look at character #1 (again, in blue); the human and chimp both have the state A, and the gorilla and orangutan share state B. That’s  most simply explained by a change in character state, from B to A, happening in one branch of the left-hand tree. But the same character would require two changes to explain the distribution of A and B among species on the right-hand tree. For that reason we say that character supports the left-hand tree but not the right-hand tree. (Character B, the one in red, supports the right-hand tree but not the left-hand tree) If we collect a great many characters and they all support the left-hand tree, that’s good evidence of a true nested hierarchy and thus a true tree of descent.
<p>

Any questions?

<p>Today is one of the middle Mondays of the <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/06/photography-contest-xiii.html">Photography Contest</a>, and I want to display a photograph sent to us by Jerry Coyne. Professor Coyne is the proprietor of the popular blog, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/">Why Evolution Is True</a>. He publishes a daily readers’ wildlife photo feature, which can include travel or street photography, and he likes to get batches of around ten photos. He requests that any PT readers who have <i>good</i> photographs submit them to j-coyne@uchicago.edu. Professor Coyne is an <a href="https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/people/emeritus-faculty">Emeritus Professor of Ecology and Evolution</a> at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>I think he must have considered my photographs to be acceptable, because he graciously posted eight of them the other day. You may see them <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/06/26/readers-wildlife-photos-1336/">here</a>, if you have not already seen some of them on PT.</p>

<p>Although William Dembski is no longer a prominent figure in the Intelligent Design movement he helped found, he does remain among its proponents and occasionally writes about it on his blog.  A recent entry entitled <a href="https://billdembski.com/intelligent-design/how-to-cover-up-design-inferences/">"How to Cover Up a Design Inference: The Coronavirus as a Case Study"</a> draws some unexpected, and unintentionally revealing, connections between ID and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> 
<p>He begins with a brief summary of his ID argument:</p>
<p><i>(My) method took the form of an inference—specifically, an inference to the best explanation. Thus the method asserted that if an event, object, or structure conforms to an independently given pattern (i.e., a specification) and if in the absence of intelligence the probability of matching that pattern is small (i.e., improbability), then a design inference is warranted. Simply put, specified improbability constitutes a method for inferring design. Moreover, things that exhibit specified improbability are best explained as the product of intelligence.</i></p>
<p>Dembski then refers to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-science-suggests-a-wuhan-lab-leak-11622995184">recent article in the Wall Street Journal</a> by medical doctor Stephen Quay and physics professor Richard Muller supporting the belief that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, did not arise naturally in an animal host as most experts believe but, rather, was artificially engineered in a Chinese lab.  In support of this belief, they claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains the sequence CGG-CGG which “in the entire class of coronaviruses that includes CoV-2… has never been found naturally.”  However, according to them, it is commonly used in “gain of function” viral experiments in the laboratory.  Their conclusion is that the presence of this sequence demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 did not have a zoonotic origin but, instead, was created by human scientists.  Dembski's response to this argument is, “If this is not a full design inference in the sense of my Cambridge University Press monograph, it’s close.”  And while he does qualify his position by saying he is not a conspiracy theorist and has not studied this issue in depth, Dembski clearly considers the possibility that the Chinese manufactured the virus to be at least highly plausible.<p>
