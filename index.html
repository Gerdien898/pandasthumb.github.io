        <p>On Valentine’s Day of this year, the <a href="https://www.amnat.org/announcements/named-awards.html">American Society of Naturalists</a> announced that it was removing individuals’ names from its awards.  Since some of us were concerned about what might lie behind this, I wrote to the Society’s Secretary, <a href="https://www.mcglothlin.biol.vt.edu/">Professor Joel McGothlin</a>, asking for clarification.</p>

<p>Our worst fears were confirmed.  We have witnessed an act of preemptive cowardice by the ASN Executive Council, much of value has been lost, and a valuable educational opportunity has been wasted. However, the changes will not take effect until this year’s awards are made.  In the meantime, I would strongly urge all members of the Society who read this, and in particular all awardees, to contact the Society through the Secretary, Professor Joel McGothlin, at joelmcg@vt.edu, and make their views known.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amnat.org/awards.html">awards affected</a> are the Sewall Wright Award, the E.O. Wilson Naturalist Award, the Jasper Loftus-Hills Young Investigator Award, the Ruth Patrick Student Poster Award, the Julia Platt Postdoc Presentation Award, and the Ed Ricketts Student Presentation Award.</p>

<p>Of these, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewall_Wright">Sewall Wright</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson">E.O. Wilson</a> need no introduction from me. <a href="https://www.amnat.org/awards.html#Jasper">Jasper Loftus-Hills</a> was an Australian biologist of exceptional promise, killed by a hit and run driver when he was conducting fieldwork, just three years after receiving his PhD. Among numerous other achievements, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Patrick">Ruth Patrick</a> established the Department of Limnology at the National Academy of Sciences, and did pioneering work on freshwater biodiversity and how it is impacted by pollution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Platt">Julia Platt</a> was the first to establish the neural crest origin of the cranium, was not able (this was in the 1890s) to obtain a PhD or an academic position in the U.S., went into politics and used her political role to establish one of the earliest marine conservation areas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Ricketts">Ed Ricketts</a> pioneered the study of intertidal ecology, and collaborated with the novelist John Steinbeck.  These are the people whose names the American Society of Naturalists no longer wishes to see prominently attached to their awards.</p>

<p>A geranium plant that I supposedly take care of has a serious infestation with whiteflies. Before dousing the plant with insecticidal soap (a procedure I am supposed to follow every week for a while), I snapped the preceding picture. There is a lot of there there, so I asked Mark Sturtevant exactly what I am looking at. His response:</p>

<blockquote><p>The spiky things are a weird part of the life cycle of whiteflies. Although they are in the order Hemiptera, which are 'supposed' to have <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/incomplete-metamorphosis/">incomplete metamorphosis</a> (passing thru nymphal stages before molting into adults), whiteflies are hemipterans that essentially have a larval stage and pupal stage of <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/complete-metamorphosis/">holometabolous</a> insects.</p>

<p>You can see quite a bit going on here in this one picture. I have re-attached your picture with some annotations.</p> 

<p>I don't know if there are eggs in view. The tiny white specks look more like glandular secretions from the leaf. But there are a few larvae along the top border of the picture, and I have marked some with an L.  You see the pupal stage already (one is marked with a P), but technically these are <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/puparium/">puparia</a>. When a larva becomes a pupa, the larva usually sheds its cuticle to show the pupa underneath, with its own cuticle. But in whiteflies (and in some other insects like flies and fleas), the larva does not shed its cuticle. Rather, it puffs it out, hardens it, and the pupal stage stays locked inside the larval cuticle. That outer larval shell is called the puparium. Then there are the adults. The large adults are females, and I have marked one with an F. Males are smaller and much more active. Winged males fly and seek out females. I think the one labelled M is a male.</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the day was warm, and there were lots of males on the window trying to get out.</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Sturtevant about the transparent spheres that clutter the frame:</p>

<blockquote>I don't know what the big spheres are, but it could be like aphids (whiteflies are related to them) which periodically secrete a drop of honeydew. This is excess water from plant sap, and aphids secrete that to concentrate the nutrients. Since whiteflies are always secreting a waxy bloom, a thin wax coating on their honeydew droplets would hold them together. That's a hypothesis, but I don't really know. </blockquote>

<p>Imperial College has decided not to rename the Huxley Building, in a partial victory for those who oppose “canceling” historical figures who held views that today are properly regarded as racist. Instead, according to an article, <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/234096/imperial-commits-ambitious-understanding-history/">Imperial commits to ‘ambitious understanding’ of history</a>, by Deborah Evanson, they will add a second, joint name to the building, in addition to that of Thomas H. Huxley. The second name will be that of “a pathbreaking scientist from a Black, Asian or other minority ethnic background.” The College will also retain a bust of Huxley, but will put Huxley and his accomplishments</p>

<blockquote>into a fuller context in order to provide everyone with a more complete understanding of Huxley’s complex character and achievements as well as his flaws, including his racially prejudiced writings. Historical context will also be provided for any person whose name is added jointly.  </blockquote>

<p>Huxley, like most of us, was indeed a complex character. He no doubt thought that white, male Englishmen were generally smarter than everyone else. In that respect he was no different from most white, male Englishmen of his time. Nevertheless, according to <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/12/Matzke-Huxley-comments.html">an article by Nick Matzke and others</a> on Panda’s Thumb last December, Huxley devoted himself to educating women and poor people, and actively opposed slavery; he was thus well in advance of many, if not most, of his contemporaries. It is gratifying that Imperial College recognizes this progressive leader and has decided not to dename the Huxley Building because of a flaw that was widely shared in his era.</p>

<p>The biologist and blogger Jerry Coyne calls the compromise “<a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/02/25/a-small-victory-thomas-henry-huxley-not-cancelled-but-contextualized-at-imperial-college/">a small victory</a>,” and I suppose it is. Huxley did not fare so well at Western Washington University, where his name was removed from the Huxley College of the Environment; see the preceding link for more background.</p>

<p>On Friday, February 18, I attended (on Zoom) a fascinating seminar given by <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/p-kilmartin">Paul Kilmartin, Professor of Chemistry</a> in the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-chemical-sciences.html">School of Chemical Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">University of Auckland</a>, here in Aotearoa/New Zealand. (<a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/nmat471">I work</a> in the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-biological-sciences.html">School of Biological Sciences</a> at the same institution.) Prof. Kilmartin specialises in wine chemistry, among other things, and in addition to chemistry, has degrees in theology and philosophy.</p>

<p>Kilmartin’s talk was entitled <b>“Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori: A Conversation.”</b> Kilmartin has given me permission to quote this part of his talk, below, which covers science education material of international interest. I will also include the talk summary. Other parts of Kilmartin’s seminar focused on his own background coming to this issue (Scottish and Māori ancestry, member of <a href="https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/">Ngāi Tahu</a>, deep knowledge of Ngāi Tahu history and land claims), and ideas for Auckland’s chemistry program to explore regarding mātauranga Māori.</p>

<p>The Panda’s Thumb blog has an international readership interested in science and science education, and I have been involved with science education controversies for 20 years (and with PT for 18!). But I’m sure the NZ situation is new to many readers. Therefore, I will give some background/introduction to the controversy around the science curriculum, after the quote from Kilmartin’s talk.  For more (much more) on current science education controversies in New Zealand, please search <a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=science%2C%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;hl=en-NZ&amp;gl=NZ&amp;ceid=NZ%3Aen">Google News</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=science%20%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/?s=mauri+zealand&amp;orderby=relevance&amp;order=DESC&amp;post_type=post">blogs</a> etc. on the various terms mentioned.</p>

<p><i>(Please not that all of non-talk material is written by me, and should not necessarily be taken as Kilmartin’s views. And, these are my personal views, not those of current or former employers.)</i></p>
