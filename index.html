<p>I try to keep up with the Discovery Institute’s site Evolution News and Science Today’.  It used to
be called ‘Evolution News and Views’ but they presumably wanted to emphasize that all that was
published there is hard factual information, so they changed the name.  I am getting a bit
behind: on the 24th of September there was a remarkable article written by Brian Miller, the Research Coordinator
of the DI’s Center for Science and Culture.</p>

<p>Under the title “Nearly All of Evolution Is Best Explained by Engineering” <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/09/nearly-all-of-evolution-is-best-explained-by-engineering/">his
post</a> notes a
report that, as notes “Transposable elements modify gene regulation in maize to confer drought tolerance,
alter flowering time, and enable plants to grow in toxic aluminum soils.”  He also mentions a number
of other cases in which organisms adapt rapidly in ways which seem to him to be the result
of their being engineered to do so.  His report is one in a series on a Conference on Engineering in
Living Systems (CELS) given in June and sponsored by the Engineering Research Group (ERG) of
the Center for Science &amp; Culture of the Discovery Institute.  Proceedings of the CELS conference
seem not to be available online at this point.</p>

<p>To Miller, this seems to be evidence of the correctness of James Shapiro’s hypothesis of
Natural Genetic Engineering (NGE).  Shapiro’s view and many references to his summaries of it
can be found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_genetic_engineering">Wikipedia article on NGE</a>.
He thinks that organisms adapt by containing mechanisms that propose, not random genetic variation, but
the genetic variation that is specifically needed in the current situation.</p>

<p>Among advocates of ID, this has been greeted with enthusiasm.  At Uncommon Descent, their in-house
science reporter “News” (Denyse O’Leary) made a similar comment about a report that reptile teeth
were gained multiple times in evolution, <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/evolution/reptiles-evolved-de-evolved-re-evolved-teeth/">on
10/16/21</a> she noted that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In short, when researchers actually looked at reptile tooth history, it was hardly a simple evolution tale at all. It seems as if there are plans that life forms can access, perhaps within their genomes. But how do they trigger the needed changes, as opposed to just going extinct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of natural genetic engineering that responds adaptively by making the needed changes in the
genome, rather than by having natural selection pick them out from among available variation, is wildly
popular among ID advocates.</p>

<p>But there are a few questions that need to be raised …</p>

<p>Not to detract from Mr. Shannon's photograph, but I rummaged around in my old files and found a snapshot I had taken of an adult lacewing, which I shall display below the fold.</p>

If I had not been familiar with <a href="https://sinaiandsynapses.org/">Sinai and Synapses</a>,* I might have dismissed this <a href="https://ejrsme.icrsme.com/issue/view/1643/222">special issue</a> of an obscure journal as yet another attempt to use science to rationalize religious beliefs. It is nothing of the kind. The entire issue consists of essays by Fellows who have been supported over the years by the Sinai and Synapses organization, about which I have said a few words below, in an Endnote. The Fellows are experts in their fields and mostly faculty at secular universities. All of them, I am certain, know what they are talking about.</p>

<p><br />The front matter contains helpful synopses of all the papers. Sometimes, I admit, the synopsis was all I wanted. I learned, however, that a second-century CE rabbi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ha-Nasi">Judah ha-Nasi</a>, had noted that “pestilence” often transferred from pigs to humans, so Rabbi Judah recommended fasting whenever pigs suffered pestilence. I wondered why on earth such an influential rabbi would care one whit about pigs, so I naturally turned first to the article, “Zoonotic pandemics and Judaism’s early-modern turn to science,” by Jonathan Crane of Emory University. I was relieved to find that Rabbi Judah did not raise pigs, but he had nevertheless noted the similarity between pigs’ organs and humans’. More strikingly, he recognized that diseases could be contagious and could be transferred from pigs to humans. Rabbi Crane introduces us to later Talmudic scholars who, in addition to citing earlier scholars and relying on their expertise, adduced their own evidence and required confirmation. Specifically, medieval Jewish scholars such as Maimonides accepted the scientific knowledge of their day, and the early modern period found Jews embracing “exogenous knowledge as well as the emerging means to discover and develop it.” Rabbi Crane continues, “To be precise, scientific method and evidence matter when it comes to physical issues like medicine and public health.”</p>

        <p>I was looking at a post today at Uncommon Descent, wondering what strange interpretation they were going to make of this palaeoanthropology report from 
Smithsonian Magazine.
On my browser, in the middle of the post there was an ad.  I know that the UD site is not responsible for which ad gets put onto the page when I view it.  In this case a bot seems
to be responding to the word “footprint”.</p>

The advertising bot appears to have decided that <em>Graecopithecus</em> needed relief for sore feet.  It does not realize that 6 million years ago hominids did not have 
Amazon accounts.

<p>I recently caught an <a href="https://think.kera.org/2021/09/29/we-cant-have-medical-progress-without-risk/">interview with Paul Offit</a>, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of vaccinology and pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The interview, originally broadcast on KERA in Dallas, was moderated by Krys Boyd. Part of the purpose of the interview, obviously, was to sell his latest book, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Bet-Your-Life-Transfusions/dp/1541620399"> You Bet Your Life</a>: From Blood Transfusions to Mass Vaccination, the Long and Risky History of Medical Innovation</i>.</p>

<p>To get immediately to the point, Dr. Offit argues convincingly that there are no risk-free choices. If you choose not to be vaccinated, then you are choosing between the risk of contracting a deadly widespread disease (and, I might add, of infecting others) and the risk of suffering from a rare side effect. Why do people choose the common disease over the rare side effect? One reason, Dr. Offit claims, is that a sin of commission may be seen as a greater risk than a sin of omission, even if statistically it is not. Thus, you may feel guilt over a sin of commission but not over a sin of omission. Further, and equally regrettably, people see themselves and their children as invulnerable – “I am strong and healthy; it won’t happen to me” – and Dr. Offit attributes this kind of denialism to the unfortunate fact that the emotional centers evolved early, before what I shall call the thinking centers. He did not, according to my notes, discuss the political implications of refusing vaccination.</p>

<p>How safe are the Covid vaccines?</p>
