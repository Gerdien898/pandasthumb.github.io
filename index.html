<p>They did not exactly do a hatchet job, but Baptist News Global just posted an article, <a href="https://baptistnews.com/article/creationism-is-big-business-in-northern-kentucky/#.YmAq2-jMKwU">Creationism is big business in Northern Kentucky</a>, by Mark Wingfield, which is fairly critical of the Ark Park, and indeed draws on an earlier article, <a href="https://ncse.ngo/anti-museum">The Anti-Museum</a>, by our colleague and sometime contributor Dan Phelps. <a href="https://baptistnews.com/more/about/#.YmA2XOjMKwU">Baptist News Global</a> is an independent publication that, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist_News_Global">Wikipedia</a>, is affiliated with the &lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Baptist_Fellowship&gt;Cooperative Baptist Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively liberal denomination that has withdrawn from the Southern Baptist Convention. Mr. Wingfield, the Executive Director of the publication, notes in his article that &lt;blockquote&gt;creationism has no support in mainstream science. A 2019 Gallup Poll found that 40% of Americans say they believe in creationism, with the likelihood of holding that belief corresponding heavily toward lower levels of education.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>At the risk of cherry-picking, he notes further,</p>
<blockquote>Phelps envisioned the museum and life-size ark appealing to home-schooling parents but also wondered if its presence could put a damper on the teaching of accepted science in the region’s schools. He called the teaching of Answers in Genesis “outrageous and remarkable pseudoscience.”</blockquote>

<p>Not a hatchet job, granted, but at least they went after the Ark with a tackhammer.</p>

<p>On the same day, William Trollinger, of the blog Righting America, posted an article, <a href="https://rightingamerica.net/ken-ham-and-the-fog-that-enshrouds-ark-encounter/">Ken Ham and the fog that enshrouds Ark Encounter</a>, which outlines the financial shenanigans that accompanied the founding of the Ark Park. Of particular note,</p>
<blockquote><a href="https://rightingamerica.net/ken-ham-and-the-government-subsidy-that-makes-ark-encounter-possible/">75% of what Ark Encounter would have paid in property taxes instead goes to paying off the bonds that made the Ark possible</a>. Quite obviously, this is a government subsidy.</blockquote>

<p>According to Mr. Trollinger, the bonds will be fully paid off this month, meaning April. He asks,</p>
<blockquote>[D]oes that mean that, after nine years of this very generous local government subsidy, Ark Encounter will finally begin to pay its fair share of property taxes? </blockquote>

<p>Let us hope so, but anyone who thinks that the Ark Park has brought prosperity to Williamstown needs to watch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6316506/">We believe in dinosaurs</a>.  Williamstown helped subsidize the Ark Park, but now unfortunately finds itself on the other side of the Interstate highway, a fact that must have been withheld from them when the Ark was begging for subsidies.</p>

<p>Finally, Ken Ham, in his blog, notes on March 26 that there is a labor shortage and proposes <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/ministry-news/issues-facing-ministry/">building dormitories</a> for summer students or, indeed, year-round students whose Christian colleges allow them to study remotely. You do not have to read very deeply between the lines to recognize that he may call these jobs “internships,” which means that he can pay anywhere from $0.00 upward. These interns will of course be a source of cheap labor and will compete with the citizens of Williamstown and elsewhere.</p>

        <p>The head is my gloss on an article, <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-04-disbelief-human-evolution-linked-greater.html">Disbelief in human evolution linked to greater prejudice and racism</a>, that was just published on the website Phys.org. It is something of a leap to infer causality, but as we shall see in a moment it is a leap made by the authors of the article. (Incidentally, I put “Darwinism” into scare quotes because I do not believe that evolutionary biology is an -ism.)</p>

<p>At any rate, in brief, Stylianos Syropoulos, a Ph.D. candidate in the War and Peace Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and his colleagues found that in the US and</p>

<blockquote>across the globe—in 19 Eastern European countries, 25 Muslim countries and in Israel—low belief in evolution was linked to higher biases within a person's group, prejudicial attitudes toward people in different groups and less support for conflict resolution.</blockquote>

        <p>About a week ago there was a media flap when the leading Republican running for senator from Georgia, football great
Herschel Walker, asked why there were still apes, if humans have evolved from apes.  This is a common silly creationist
talking point.  It is usually stated as the question “why are there still monkeys”.  There's really not much
reason to spend time refuting it; it reflects an elementary misunderstanding of what evolutionary biologists say
about human evolution.</p>

<p>But what was more astonishing was how our knowledgeable and sophisticated press explained the matter to its readers.  Here are some
jaw-dropping explanations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CNN’s Editor-at-large Chris Cilizza explained
<a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2022/03/16/politics/herschel-walker-geogia-senate-candidate-evolution-apes/index.html">here</a>
that “Humans and apes evolved from the same genetic ape ancestors, a species now long extinct. (It’s known as “common
descent.”) We did not, however, evolve directly from the current occupants of your local zoo. They are one branch of
descent from their ape ancestors. Humans are another.”  And he quotes an evolutionary biologist, Fabio Mendes, as
saying that “Humans and apes evolved from the same genetic ape ancestors, a species now long extinct. (It’s known as
“common descent.”) We did not, however, evolve directly from the current occupants of your local zoo. They are one
branch of descent from their ape ancestors. Humans are another.”</li>
  <li>The digital media report The Hill <a href="https://thehill.com/media/598393-herschel-walker-asks-why-are-there-still-apes-in-discussion-about-evolution">played it
safe</a>, relying on PBS: “According to a PBS FAQ about evolution, “Humans
are more closely related to modern apes … but we didn’t evolve from apes, either. Humans share a common ancestor
with modern African apes. … Scientists believe this common ancestor existed 5 to 8 million years ago. Shortly
thereafter, the species diverged into two separate lineages. One of these lineages ultimately evolved into gorillas and
chimps, and the other evolved into early human ancestors called hominids.” (The PBS FAQ was actually from a 2001 science
program “Evolution”, a series funded by a foundation of Paul Allen’s.  It <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/faq/cat02.html">can be found
here</a>).  It in turn has links to some respectable sources,
some to the Talk.Origins site, which itself cites a couple of articles here at Panda’s Thumb.</li>
  <li>A fact-checking site, Politifact, has its article
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/17/herschel-walker/yes-evolution-proves-humans-and-apes-can-coexist/">here</a>.
It is slightly more vague on the issue, but does say that “Humans and the apes known today both evolved from ancient apes, who are now extinct. This split occurred between 6-8 million years ago based on genetic and fossil evidence.  Over time, humans and apes have been evolving in their own ways to adapt in their respective environments.”
and also that “Humans and modern-day apes both evolved from ancient apes, who are now extinct. Anthropologists using
genetic and fossil evidence pinpoint it between 6-8 million years ago. Humans and the apes seen today evolved
differently over time.”</li>
</ul>

<p>The message is clear.  Apes, who, us?  We evolved from something, but it wasn’t an ape.  Nosiree!  Apes evolved
separately from us, right?</p>

<p><em>Not right</em>, of course.  Which means we ought to discuss why so many people who know evolution happened can’t seem to
say that we evolved from apes, that in fact <em>we are apes</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s think about this …</p>
