<p>It is perhaps a caricature to claim that conservatives think all inequality is genetic, so there is nothing we can do about it. It is probably less of a caricature to claim that liberals think no inequality is genetic, so all we have to worry about is environmental. At least one purpose of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genetic-Lottery-Matters-Social-Equality/dp/0691190801">The Genetic Lottery</a> by Kathryn Paige Harden, Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, is apparently to convince liberals that people’s differing genetic inheritances may contribute to inequality (see also a &lt;a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/can-progressives-be-convinced-that-genetics-matters&gt;profile of the author&lt;/a&gt; by Gideon Lewis-Krauss in <i>The New Yorker</i>).</p>

<p>I do not know why liberals and minority groups (they are overlapping sets) are afraid of research linking, for example, genes and intelligence, but I can guess along with Dr. Harden that it is related to their justifiable fear of eugenics. Comparing Dr. Harden’s work to eugenics is a bit like conflating nuclear power with nuclear bombs; it is right to be afraid of one, but not necessarily the other, and certainly not to be afraid of one because of the other.</p>

<p>Dr. Harden’s book is in two parts: “Taking Genetics Seriously” and “Taking Equality Seriously.” The first is a mostly scientific discussion of the relation between genes and various traits such as intelligence, which she claims partly determine your income and status. I found it a useful primer. The second part is more political and cries for mostly unspecified actions designed to increase the status of those who may be tacitly discriminated against because of a poor genetic inheritance.</p>

William Dembski summarizes the status of ID (link to YouTube video is below)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Discovery Institute had released a YouTube video of William Dembski’s 30-minute talk last March at the
DI’s Dallas Conference on Science and Faith.  This conference, whose other talks have not yet been made
available, was supposed to occur on February 20 but was postponed until March 13 and made into mostly a virtual
conference.  There was an in-person gathering at the Denton Bible Church, and Dembski’s
talk looks like it was in-person.  The
other speakers were Marcos Eberlin, Stephen Meyer, Casey Luskin, and Melissa Cain Travis.</p>

<p>The interest in this talk is mainly in what he describes as the current state of the Intelligent
Design movement.  He feels that its intellectual arguments have been a substantial success, but
that society has mostly not been persuaded to accept them.</p>

<p>You will find the Youtube video of his 30-minute talk on “Gauging the Success of Intelligent
Design” <a href="https://youtu.be/mDD7pARRfm4"><strong>here</strong></a>.   Take a look.  The talk is only 30 minutes
long.  Which arguments does he consider to be valid?  The part about how successful ID
has been starts 20 minutes in, but there is much before that that illuminates his
perspective …</p>

<p>The other day, I (MY) received note from the Kentucky paleontologist Dan Phelps. The note was an anguished letter that he had sent to the PBS affiliate Kentucky Educational Television and was headed</p>

<p><big>If someone dies, what will KET say?</big></p>

<p>What anguished Mr. Phelps was the station’s airing of a program called “Ancient Remedies” by a quack nutritionist (or something) called Josh Axe. It seems that KET is not the only affiliate that runs his “advice”: so do Rhode Island PBS, New Hampshire PBS, Arizona Public Media, Duluth-Superior Area Educational Television, Kansas Public Television, Blue Ridge PBS, Delta College Public Media, PBS Western Reserve, and I suppose more, but I gave up looking. In my own area, it looks like PBS12, Colorado Public Television, carries the program, but Rocky Mountain PBS does not. May we suggest that after you read this post you check your own PBS affiliate and if appropriate complain about their airing this nonsense.</p>

<p>I had never heard of Josh Axe, so I looked him up and watched – no, endured an hour-long program <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxIbJEhMrzQ"> here</a>. I did not take notes, but what I came away with was</p>

<ul><li>Cancer is a psychosomatic disease (my interpretation of what he said)</li>
<li> Certain personality types and get breast cancer on the left side, others on the right, depending on some mumbo jumbo about qi (chi)</li>
<li>The plural of anecdote is data; Chinese medicine is 5000 (?) years old and has accumulated plenty of data (he does not seem to have heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>)</li>
<li>Western medicine believes in evidence (again, my interpretation; I do not remember his precise wording)</li>
<li>And, finally, like cures like, so walnuts are good for your brain, or something like that, reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy">homeopathy</a>, only worse </li></ul>

<p>I now yield the floor to my colleague Dan Phelps, who started this discussion with the following letter to KET:</p>

<p>An observant reader sent us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aigkenham/photos/4898302493533401">this picture</a>, which was the subject of a tweet by Ken Ham of AIG, and noted that the caption should have been</p>

<p><strong><big>"Fired because my beliefs endangered the health and safety of others."</big></strong></p>

<p>He further commented,</p>

<blockquote><p>Seriously, it doesn't bother AiG to fire or not to hire people because they don't believe what the organization requires (this behavior is legal under the Civil Rights Act, BTW, if carefully structured). SO why do they take such umbrage when someone else does the same thing?</p> 

<p>And, there certainly is a clear and present danger to acting on these [anti-vaccination] beliefs, whereas I would be hard pressed to find such a danger among, say, other Christian denominations that do not follow the bizarre twists that AiG insists on. </p></blockquote>
