<p>Imperial College has decided not to rename the Huxley Building, in a partial victory for those who oppose “canceling” historical figures who held views that today are properly regarded as racist. Instead, according to an article, <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/234096/imperial-commits-ambitious-understanding-history/">Imperial commits to ‘ambitious understanding’ of history</a>, by Deborah Evanson, they will add a second, joint name to the building, in addition to that of Thomas H. Huxley. The second name will be that of “a pathbreaking scientist from a Black, Asian or other minority ethnic background.” The College will also retain a bust of Huxley, but will put Huxley and his accomplishments</p>

<blockquote>into a fuller context in order to provide everyone with a more complete understanding of Huxley’s complex character and achievements as well as his flaws, including his racially prejudiced writings. Historical context will also be provided for any person whose name is added jointly.  </blockquote>

<p>Huxley, like most of us, was indeed a complex character. He no doubt thought that white, male Englishmen were generally smarter than everyone else. In that respect he was no different from most white, male Englishmen of his time. Nevertheless, according to <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/12/Matzke-Huxley-comments.html">an article by Nicholas Matzke and others</a> on Panda’s Thumb last December, Huxley devoted himself to educating women and poor people, and actively opposed slavery; he was thus well in advance of many, if not most, of his contemporaries. It is gratifying that Imperial College recognizes this progressive leader and has decided not to dename the Huxley Building because of a flaw that was widely shared in his era.</p>

<p>The biologist and blogger Jerry Coyne calls the compromise “<a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/02/25/a-small-victory-thomas-henry-huxley-not-cancelled-but-contextualized-at-imperial-college/">a small victory</a>,” and I suppose it is. Huxley did not fare so well at Western Washington University, where his name was removed from the Huxley College of the Environment; see the preceding link for more background.</p>

<p>On Friday, February 18, I attended (on Zoom) a fascinating seminar given by <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/p-kilmartin">Paul Kilmartin, Professor of Chemistry</a> in the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-chemical-sciences.html">School of Chemical Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">University of Auckland</a>, here in Aotearoa/New Zealand. (<a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/nmat471">I work</a> in the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-biological-sciences.html">School of Biological Sciences</a> at the same institution.) Prof. Kilmartin specialises in wine chemistry, among other things, and in addition to chemistry, has degrees in theology and philosophy.</p>

<p>Kilmartin’s talk was entitled <b>“Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori: A Conversation.”</b> Kilmartin has given me permission to quote this part of his talk, below, which covers science education material of international interest. I will also include the talk summary. Other parts of Kilmartin’s seminar focused on his own background coming to this issue (Scottish and Māori ancestry, member of <a href="https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/">Ngāi Tahu</a>, deep knowledge of Ngāi Tahu history and land claims), and ideas for Auckland’s chemistry program to explore regarding mātauranga Māori.</p>

<p>The Panda’s Thumb blog has an international readership interested in science and science education, and I have been involved with science education controversies for 20 years (and with PT for 18!). But I’m sure the NZ situation is new to many readers. Therefore, I will give some background/introduction to the controversy around the science curriculum, after the quote from Kilmartin’s talk.  For more (much more) on current science education controversies in New Zealand, please search <a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=science%2C%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;hl=en-NZ&amp;gl=NZ&amp;ceid=NZ%3Aen">Google News</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=science%20%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/?s=mauri+zealand&amp;orderby=relevance&amp;order=DESC&amp;post_type=post">blogs</a> etc. on the various terms mentioned.</p>

<p><i>(Please not that all of non-talk material is written by me, and should not necessarily be taken as Kilmartin’s views. And, these are my personal views, not those of current or former employers.)</i></p>

        <p>This is perhaps slightly off-topic, but we have not heard from the neo-Confederate and one-time secessionist <a href="http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2014/05/1022-michael-peroutka.html">Michael Peroutka</a> in a long time, not since he <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/dinosaur-fossil.html">donated a dinosaur fossil to the Creation "Museum"</a> or <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/11/michael-peroutk.html">was elected to the Anne Arundel County Council in Maryland</a>. According to an <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-peroutka-ag-20220202-x6lcsbwfynaordddshodb7tlt4-story.html">article</a> by Pamela Wood in yesterday’s  <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, he now plans a run for Attorney General of Maryland. As we noted in 2014,</p>
<blockquote>… Michael Peroutka until recently was also a board member of the League of the South, a white supremacist, neo-Confederate and pro-secessionist organization that has been <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/league-south">named a hate group</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center. </blockquote>

<p>Let us hope that the citizens of Maryland show more discernment than the citizens of Anne Arundel County.</p>

        <figure><figcaption> The left-handed DNA helix model that was displayed in the Seattle World's Fair ended up in storage
in a utility tunnel underneath the Pacific Science Center.  (We'll show the image here as soon as we get
permission to show it on this page.)  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PacSci/photos/pcb.10152437776723855/10152437771508855/">This link</a> shows the image on the PSC Facebook page.</figcaption></figure>

<p>On January 11, Matt Young reported that the Institute for Creation Science announced a new logo that depicted left-handed DNA. Although regularly occurring in vivo in the form of Z-DNA left-handed DNA only represent a very tiny proportion of the world’s DNA which consists predominantly of right-handed B-DNA as Watson and Crick described it in their 1954 paper.</p>

<p>The ICR left-handed DNA logo made it on the pages of <a href="http://users.fred.net/tds/leftdna/">Tom Schneider’s Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame</a> immediately and became the sites first entry in 2022.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Institute for Creation Research has created a new logo representing their support for left handed DNA research and the ongoing takeover! First reported on 2022 Jan 11, new as of 2022 Jan 112</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most cases depicting DNA left-handed will be caused by mirroring a correct picture to better suit design purposes or likely more often by copying publicly available pictures. The same may be true for the ICR logo. Still, the incident reminded me of the likely first ever publicly displayed left-handed DNA model that was part of the Science Exhibition at the Seattle World Fair in 1962 which I came across when I studied the history of a right-handed DNA model Max Delbrück purchased for the Institute of Genetics of the University of Cologne.</p>
