<p>If have been reading, for example, <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i> for 40 years or so, you may think you have little to gain from reading this splendid, newish book by the eminent geologist Donald Prothero. You would not be more wrong.</p>

<p>The book, <a href="https://iupress.org/9781684351794/weird-earth/">Weird Earth</a>, is subtitled “Debunking strange ideas about our planet,” and debunk it does. I thought I knew a lot of the strange ideas about the planet, and indeed I did. But did I know the details? Usually not. Further, I had no idea that the earth is expanding (it is not), that Mount Shasta is riddled with tunnels leading to a secret city (it is not), nor that <i>ley lines</i> connect various points on a map (they do not).
Professor Prothero devotes 16 chapters to debunking these and other concepts in some detail. Mostly the exposition was clear and I understood it easily; only rarely did I have to grapple with a description or explanation.</p>

<p>The book actually contains 18 chapters. The first describes “Science and critical thinking.” This chapter briefly discusses how “[s]cience is a way of thinking about the world.” If I had one criticism, it would regard the common claim that scientists actively attempt to disprove, or falsify, their hypotheses. It is not as simple as that, though surely when good scientists find that their hypotheses have been falsified, they will react accordingly. Nevertheless, when Rutherford traveled to the south seas, he did not intend to falsify general relativity. (See my post and comments <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/04/scientific-attitude.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>The last chapter explains <i>why</i> people believe weird things and introduces such concepts as motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, backfire effect, compartmentalism and cognitive dissonance, and even tribalism. Professor Prothero marvels at the existence of “smart idiots,” who “selectively bias what they learn” in order to defend their (weird) beliefs to their followers. Indeed, he argues that “the root of most of our cognitive biases is tribalism,” a claim that, if true, requires a somewhat broad definition of tribalism. He goes back, convincingly, to the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine during the Reagan administration to explain today’s proliferation of nonsense on formerly reputable television channels. Were I writing the book, I might have combined this chapter with the first or made it the second, so that readers would more readily understand why people believed weird things, but maybe that is just a matter of taste.</p>

<p>A team of geologists from West Virginia University has discovered what are apparently living cells in halite (rock salt) estimated to be 830 Ma old and more than 1.5 km below the surface. You may read a summary by Michelle Starr in <i>Science Alert</i> <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/830-million-year-old-microorganisms-found-trapped-in-australian-rock">here</a>, or you may find the full article in <i>Geology</i> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1130/G49957.1">here</a>.</p>

<p>The geologists used optical and ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy and found what they think are algal and prokaryotic cells trapped inside liquid inclusions in the halite. It is at least possible that the cells are alive, judging by the fluorescence spectra.</p>

<p>I checked with a biologist, who confirmed my intuition that a seed or a spore, in order to remain alive, must display at least minimal metabolism. It is therefore hard to imagine a spore lasting for so many years, and indeed the <i>Geology</i> paper notes that the “microorganisms may survive in fluid inclusions by metabolic changes, including starvation survival and cyst stages, and coexistence with organic compounds or dead cells that could serve as nutrient sources,” that is, that they may have been active sometimes and dormant at other times.</p>

<p>Years ago, we used some green branches as tomato stakes. At the end of the season, we noticed some green leaves at the top end of one or more of the stakes. “How stubborn life is!” my mother exclaimed. She did not know the half of it.</p>

<figcaption><a href="https://www.cicadamania.com/cicadas/common-cicadas-of-north-america/">Cicada</a> &ndash; unknown species, Lexington, Kentucky, July 17, 2015. Mr. Phelps notes, "The cicada was on my back porch. It apparently crawled up a beam after digging itself out of the ground. It split its nymph skin and was in the process of letting its wings dry when I took the photo. They are beautifully colored when they first come out like this. They eventually become darker colors. This is an annual cicada, not one of the 13- or 17-year types. Don’t know which species since this one just molted. Most of the photos available for identification are for ones that are not freshly molted from the nymph stage. This photo is rotated correctly &ndash; the nymph had been crawling up the post before stopping to split its skin and emerge as an adult."

<p>Let me thank Joe Felsenstein for <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/05/rosenhouse-on-mathematical-anti-evolutionism.html">mentioning my new book</a> <i>The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism</i>, which is now available from Cambridge University Press.  The original intention was for a book discussing mathematics and evolution more generally, with just one section devoted to anti-evolutionary nonsense.  But when that section ran into the hundreds of pages with no end in sight, we decided just to make the whole book a response to the nonsense.</p>

<p>Mathematics has considerable propaganda value for anti-evolutionists since it can be used to confuse a lay audience into thinking that something profound has been said.  It also offers the possibility of an in-principle argument.  If the numbers say evolution is impossible then that is the end of the story, regardless of any circumstantial evidence drawn from paleontology, genetics, anatomy, and so on.</p>

  Jason Rosenhouse, <em>The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism</em>.  Cambridge
University Press, 2022.
<p>

Written by a mathematician who has paid close attention to mathematical arguments
against evolution, this is a beautifully written and careful refutation of
those arguments.  Actually, that sentence I plagiarized from the back cover
of this book.  But I don't have to worry about having done that, since it
comes from a blurb written by me.  I also gave Jason Rosenhouse comments on the
manuscript.
<p>
Jason Rosenhouse is a professor of mathematics at James Madison University
who also writes popularizations of his field, including a book on the
mathematics of Sudoku and one on the Monty Hall Problem (you know:
the one with the doors and the goats).  Is he overreaching by taking on
creationist and ID arguments?  Hardly: he has written extensively
on this, including many posts here in PT starting in its first year. For a while had his own
blog called EvolutionBlog.  He attended creationist and ID conferences
and wrote about that experience in his 2012 book, <em>Among the Creationists. Dispatches from the Anti-Evolutionist Front Line</em>.
<p>
This is a lovely and fascinating book which covers the most
widely-cited mathematical arguments against evolution, explaining them and
their weaknesses lucidly for a general audience.  If you are not
writing a review for one of the Discovery Institute sites, you
will be impressed.
<p>
Let me outline the chapters, to give you a general picture of what
is covered ...
