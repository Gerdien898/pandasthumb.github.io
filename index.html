One can always count on the ID/creationist website Uncommon Descent for oddities.  Yesterday they noticed a post here: Timothy Sandefur's
discussion of the legal issues raised by the rightward move of the U.S. Supreme Court, and the legal theories the court majority used 
to address separation of church and state.  And how the court might now rule on a case like the Dover School Board case.  (Tim's post 
is of course, found <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/religious-conservatism-on-the-Supreme-Court.html">here</a>).
  </p>
<p>
 The UD post <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/at-pandas-thumb-worry-that-the-u-s-supreme-court-will-rule-for-creationism/">(here)</a> is 
 signed by their official reporter "News", who seems these days to be physicist Eric Hedin. They first quote a paragraph from Sandefur's post 
 about the flaws in the legal theory of "originalism" used by the Supreme Court majority.  Then
they close in for the kill, saying:
<blockquote>For some, tormenting themselves with this stuff probably seems to make more sense than confronting the fact that 
Darwinism (which is generally what they mean by “evolution”) isn’t as widely believed as it used to be within biology. Never 
mind what a judge thinks should be taught to kids in school.</blockquote>
<p>
They follow this with a paragraph from the Discovery Institute site <em>Mind Matters</em> touting a science commentary article from 
<em>The Guardian</em> which advocates the renaming of the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis because it has been incorporating 
too many new phenonmena.

William Dembski has now reviewed my new book <em>The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism</em>.  His review comes to roughly 18000 words.  According to at least one standard classification scheme, that makes it a novella.  The full review can be found <a href="https://billdembski.com/intelligent-design/success-of-mathematics-in-advancing-intelligent-design/">here</a>.  It is also appearing in sections at the Discovery Institute's site Evolution News (see <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/author/wdembski/">here</a>).
<p>
It is a person of rare talent who can write at such length without getting anything right.  Dembski’s response consists mostly of lengthy, irrelevant digressions that have little to do with anything I actually wrote, out-of-context sentences and sentence fragments from my book that seem specifically intended to mislead his readers about my arguments, and his usual arrogance and self-puffery about his own brilliance.  He obsesses over minor comments I include in a chapter’s endnotes, while ignoring the main argument I made in the chapter itself.  When he does get around to responding to an argument, he seems in most cases not even to understand the point I was making.  Frankly, I could easily have written a more cogent reply to my own book.
<p>
I will only respond to what I regard as the most important points and will simply ignore large swaths of his review.  To anything that I do not specifically address, you can assume my response is to roll my eyes and say, “Whatever.  Let him blather.”

        <p>It’s always a risky game to predict what the Supreme Court will do about anything, but we can always discern the general trends, and as a decades-long member of the (spooky, scary!) Federalist Society, I thought I’d take a crack at answering the first three of Joe Felsenstein’s questions about the future of teaching evolution.</p>
<p>
<em>What would this court do if asked to decide a case similar to the Dover School Board case?</em>
<p>
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District"><em>the Dover case</em></a> — which, believe it or not, is going on 20 years ago, now — the district court found that the school board violated the First Amendment by adopting an “Intelligent Design Policy.” This policy required that a statement be read to students in ninth grade biology class which said that biological evolution “is not a fact,” that it contained “gaps ... for which there is no evidence,” and that “Intelligent Design ... differs from Darwin’s view.” It encouraged students to consult <em>Of Pandas and People</em>, a book which advocated ID creationism, and which was made available to students. After a thorough trial on the factual issues, the court found this unconstitutional using two different legal tests: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorsement_test">“Endorsement Test”</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman#Lemon_test">“Lemon test.”</a> 
<p>
These tests are intellectual devices judges use to answer whether government has crossed the constitutional lines that bar it from either establishing a religion — that is, creating an official church or creed of some kind — or inhibiting the free exercise of religion — that is, punishing or burdening someone for practicing a faith. And these two tests are quite similar. The Lemon test, however, is a three-part analysis dating back to the 1971 case of <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman</em>. The Endorsement Test is somewhat older.
