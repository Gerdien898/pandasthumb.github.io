        <p>Happy birthday, Jean-Baptiste!  On this day, August 1, in 1744 Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de Lamarck, was born.  Had he lived he would now be a sprightly 
278 years old.  It is time for my annual birthday post.  He was the first evolutionary biologist.  In addition to world-class work in invertebrate taxonomy he argued for common descent and put forward a mechanism to account for adaptation.  No not inheritance of acquired characters – everyone always knew that it was true.  The mechanism was Use and Disuse. Organisms tried to solve their problems by using (or disusing) their organs, and the resulting changes would be adaptive and of course would be passed on to the next generation.  Lamarck also believed that,
in addition, there was an overall force in descent of organisms in nature leading to an increase of complexity.</p>

<p>Is Lamarckism dead now?  Well, yes and no.  Let me explain …</p>

This creature entered the house and was very kindly walking on a glass window when I snapped this picture. Mark Sturtevant tells me, "There are statements that if it has isolated black spots on the abdomen, like this one does, then it's a queen. Queens commonly turn up in houses early in the season or late in the season as they wind up in there when seeking shelter to overwinter."

<p>Dismissals of evolutionary biology have come at such a pace lately that we need at least a monthly report on how the previous month’s evolutionary theory has been overthrown. I hope that this can 
be a regular feature.  I figure that once a month is about 
right, as there are enough overthrows of evolutionary theory to
supply it.  Well, actually I hope that there will be no
need for such a series, but alas …</p>

<p>This month we report on two such events:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The hoatzin, a silly-looking bird that looks like a confused
chicken, is hard to place on the phylogeny of birds.  An 
article in <em>The New Yorker</em> suggests that this may discredit
the very notion of a phylogeny.  That in turn has led to comments
by many of the usual suspects.  One of the major scientific papers on
bird phylogeny has as an author our own John Harshman.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A survey of new discoveries in evolutionary biology appeared
in <em>The Guardian</em>.  Its author called for existing
evolutionary theory to be tossed out and for it to be replaced
by the thinking of the supporters of the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis.  The piece has been welcomed by creationists and
advocates of ID, and criticized by pro-evolution websites.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>“Below the fold” you will find some more details and links.  Will
the new paradigms still be around a month from now?</p>

<p>It is interesting that, as of Wednesday (July 13) late afternoon, that Answers 
in Genesis has posted nothing about the spectacular preliminary results from the James Webb 
Space Telescope (JWST) released the previous day. Most people probably missed it, but AiG 
has responded in a very poor way, on their Facebook and possibly other social media. On 
Tuesday, July 12 on AiG’s and Ken Ham’s Facebook pages, there was a simulcast of the NASA 
press conference where the first photos and results from the JWST were shown. Here is the link to the Ham Facebook post of the simulcast video: 
﻿<a href="https://fb.watch/ee25qVAHqq/?mibextid=qZdngE&amp;fs=e&amp;s=cl">https://fb.watch/ee25qVAHqq/?mibextid=qZdngE&amp;fs=e&amp;s=cl</a>.
I don’t know if you have to have a Facebook account to view this.  (It is also available on Youtube
<a href="https://youtu.be/od6829WF-S4">here</a>).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Their response was by AiG’s astronomer, Dr. Danny Faulkner, and their “rocket scientist,” Rob 
Webb. Their discussion was a rather weak critique of the JWST’s findings and funny and sad at the same 
time. Through most of their simulcast, one couldn’t hear what the NASA people were saying, but this 
may have been a technical difficulty. About 23 minutes in Dr. Faulkner and Webb bizarrely claim that 
light year distances don’t necessarily equal long time scales (thus not refuting a 6,000 year old 
universe). Soon after, Dr. Faulkner states his “theory” (not a scientific theory, but he doesn’t seem 
to know this) that we can see things billions of light years away in a 6,000 year old universe because 
of a “miracle.” His position is literally “then a miracle occurred.” This is reminiscent of the famous 
Sidney Harris cartoon found <a href="http://www.sciencecartoonsplus.com/pages/gallery.php">here:</a>. Dr. Faulkner 
goes on to say that Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden saw pretty much what we see today when 
looking at the night sky.</p>
