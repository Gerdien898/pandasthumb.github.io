<p>Today is one of the middle Mondays of the <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/06/photography-contest-xiii.html">Photography Contest</a>, and I want to display a photograph sent to us by Jerry Coyne. Professor Coyne is the proprietor of the popular blog, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/">Why Evolution Is True</a>. He publishes a daily readers’ wildlife photo feature, which can include travel or street photography, and he likes to get batches of around ten photos. He requests that any PT readers who have <i>good</i> photographs submit them to j-coyne@uchicago.edu. Professor Coyne is an <a href="https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/people/emeritus-faculty">Emeritus Professor of Ecology and Evolution</a> at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>I think he must have considered my photographs to be acceptable, because he graciously posted eight of them the other day. You may see them <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/06/26/readers-wildlife-photos-1336/">here</a>, if you have not already seen some of them on PT.</p>

<p>Although William Dembski is no longer a prominent figure in the Intelligent Design movement he helped found, he does remain among its proponents and occasionally writes about it on his blog.  A recent entry entitled <a href="https://billdembski.com/intelligent-design/how-to-cover-up-design-inferences/">"How to Cover Up a Design Inference: The Coronavirus as a Case Study"</a> draws some unexpected, and unintentionally revealing, connections between ID and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> 
<p>He begins with a brief summary of his ID argument:</p>
<p><i>(My) method took the form of an inference—specifically, an inference to the best explanation. Thus the method asserted that if an event, object, or structure conforms to an independently given pattern (i.e., a specification) and if in the absence of intelligence the probability of matching that pattern is small (i.e., improbability), then a design inference is warranted. Simply put, specified improbability constitutes a method for inferring design. Moreover, things that exhibit specified improbability are best explained as the product of intelligence.</i></p>
<p>Dembski then refers to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-science-suggests-a-wuhan-lab-leak-11622995184">recent article in the Wall Street Journal</a> by medical doctor Stephen Quay and physics professor Richard Muller supporting the belief that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, did not arise naturally in an animal host as most experts believe but, rather, was artificially engineered in a Chinese lab.  In support of this belief, they claim that SARS-CoV-2 contains the sequence CGG-CGG which “in the entire class of coronaviruses that includes CoV-2… has never been found naturally.”  However, according to them, it is commonly used in “gain of function” viral experiments in the laboratory.  Their conclusion is that the presence of this sequence demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 did not have a zoonotic origin but, instead, was created by human scientists.  Dembski's response to this argument is, “If this is not a full design inference in the sense of my Cambridge University Press monograph, it’s close.”  And while he does qualify his position by saying he is not a conspiracy theorist and has not studied this issue in depth, Dembski clearly considers the possibility that the Chinese manufactured the virus to be at least highly plausible.<p>

<img src="/uploads/2021/DSC04337_Sekonic_Light_Meter_600.jpg" alt="Light meter" />
<figcaption>Sekonic light meter designed to fit on accessory shoe for 35-mm camera. This is perhaps somewhat off-task, but I cannot find a date for the meter. The accessory shoe, soon to evolve into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_shoe">hot shoe</a>, was developed in the 1970's, so the meter probably predates 1970. The highest ASA (ISO) speed is 3200, so the meter probably cannot date as early as the 1940's or even 1950's (Kodak Royal X Pan came out around 1957 with an astronomical ASA daylight speed of 1250). The meter is worth about $30 US, used.<br /><br />
For the uninitiated, you set the ASA speed by rotating the inner ring. In this case the ASA speed is 80. The meter reads "3," so rotate the outer ring till the tick is opposite the <i>red</i> 3. Then read the exposure &ndash; for example, F/11 and 1/100&nbsp;s. Now set your camera accordingly and take the picture. If your camera uses exposure values (EV), then use the number next to the black ASA speed (the black and red numbers are used to avoid crowding).<br /><br />
The meter is photovoltaic, which means that (a) it is not as sensitive as a battery-powered photoconductive meter, but (b) it still works. You may convert the meter to an incident-light meter by opening the little door on the upper edge of the case.

<p>The 13th annual Panda’s Thumb Photography Contest begins now, Monday, June 21, at 12:00 p.m., MDT (MDT = UTC(GMT) – 6 h). Entries will be accepted between now and Wednesday, July 7, at 12:00 p.m., MDT. The rules are precisely the same as <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2020/06/photography-contest-xii.html">last year’s</a>, except, obviously, that the dates have been updated.</p>

<p>We encourage entries in a single, general category, which includes pictures of just about anything of scientific interest: any object of experimentation or observation, from single-celled organisms, through nematodes, fruit flies, rats, chimpanzees, and college sophomores to volcanoes, stars, and galaxies. In order not to omit theoreticians, we will consider computer-generated pictures and also photographs of equipment. Photomicrographs and electron micrographs are likewise welcomed.</p>

<p>Since rumor has it that the pandemic encouraged macro photography, we may, if we receive enough entries, establish a “macro” category.</p>

<p>The winner and the runner-up will receive a copy of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534976/improbable-destinies-by-jonathan-b-losos/">Improbable Destinies</a> by Jonathan Losos, generously donated by the <a href="https://ncse.com/">National Center for Science Education</a>, and a copy of one of my own books.</p>

        <p>ID-creationists Ola Hössjer, Günter Bechly, and Ann Gauger have managed to get a paper published <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519321000795">(Hössjer et al. 2021)</a> in the Journal of Theoretical Biology, in which they argue that a complex adaptation would take a very long time to evolve given certain imaginary conditions.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2021/JTBHBG2021.jpg" alt="JTB IDcreationist paper" /></p>

<p>They never give any evidence that any known complex adaptation had to evolve through their imaginary scenario, so the relevance of their paper to real biology is only that, imaginary.</p>
