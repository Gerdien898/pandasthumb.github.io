<p>The Discovery Institute, principal advocate of the Intelligent Design (ID) movement in the US, attempts to invalidate scientific results demonstrating that so-called <i>irreducibly complex (IC)</i> biological traits can evolve naturally. According to the ID protagonist Michael Behe (1996), a system is <i>by definition</i> irreducibly complex if it consists of several specifically interacting components which together produce a function such that the removal of any single component leads to the failure of this function. Most biochemical systems are irreducibly complex in that sense. Since they cannot be less complex without losing their function, unguided natural processes based on random mutations and selection cannot build them up gradually, according to Behe. Instead, multiple coordinated mutations would be required <i>simultaneously</i>.</p>

<p>Behe postulates that a stepwise evolution of such systems is too improbable to have happened if more than two coordinated mutations, two specific binding sites among proteins, or two specific interdependencies between the parts of a system were established in one fell swoop. Such systems are beyond the “edge of evolution,” Behe says, and need an intelligent creator. This is the so-called <i>argument from irreducible complexity</i> (IC argument).</p>

<p>However, within the last 25 years, ID advocates were faced with more and more logical arguments and empirical data which made apparent that their perception of how evolution works is untenable. One intriguing example is the evolution of a mitochondrial gene in the corn plant <i>Zea mays</i> named <i>T-URF13</i> which encodes a ligand-gated pore forming receptor protein called URF13 protein (Hunt 2007).</p>

<p>Jason Rosenhouse’s newest book, <i>The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism</i>, is a mathematics book, not a book on evolution, and not a book on creationism or theology. Though the author plainly believes in – no: though the author plainly <i>accepts</i> evolution, his main purpose is to show that the mathematical arguments of anti-evolutionists are flatly wrong, rather than to defend evolution explicitly.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rosenhouse">Jason Rosenhouse</a> is an American author who has written several books, including <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199744633.001.0001/acprof-9780199744633">Among the Creationists: Dispatches from the Anti-Evolutionist Front Line</a>. His experience as a mathematician and of actually wading into the swamp of creationism make him uniquely qualified to have written the present book.</p>

<p>Joe Felsenstein has posted an <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/05/rosenhouse-on-mathematical-anti-evolutionism.html">annotated table of contents</a>, and Prof. Rosenhouse himself has presented an essay <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/05/futility-anti-evolutionary.html">The futility of anti-evolutionary mathematics</a> on PT; I will not try to duplicate either of those. Additionally, if you want to get a feeling for some of the more egregious nonsense, you might want to read <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/06/has-michael-egnor-shown-everything.html">Has Michael Egnor shown that everything is intelligently designed?</a>, also by Joe Felsenstein. I cannot make, um, head or tail of Dr. Egnor’s argument, except that he seems to think that if you use tossing coins in an illustrative manner, then you must think that the coins themselves were formed by natural causes.</p>

Michael Egnor, by all accounts a talented neurosurgeon, has come up with an extraordinary argument at Evolution News, the Discovery Institute's site where they attempt to excise evolutionary thinking.  His argument, which is aimed at
Jason Rosenhouse's book <em>The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism</em>, can be found <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/06/rosenhouses-blunder-another-nonsensical-mathematical-argument-against-intelligent-design/">at this link</a>.   Thanks to Jack Krebs for pointing out this extraordinary paragraph, about Jason's analogy to coin-tossing:

<blockquote>
For Rosenhouse’s analogy to point to unintelligent causes — to Darwinian natural selection — he would have to invoke the analogy that we leave a block of silver on a table by itself and wait for it to (by erosion and wind) sculpt itself into 100 coins, each of which would then spontaneously fall off the table, and the coins that landed tails up would then spontaneously (perhaps by earthquakes!) jump back up onto the table and spontaneously fall again, with this mindless but amazingly specific cycle repeating itself until all 100 coins lay heads-up on the floor (and the floor would first have to assemble itself!). This is a fine model of Darwinian natural selection.
</blockquote>

What is Egnor trying to argue?  I think a major issue is, to what does this argument <em>not</em> apply?  Is it arguing that natural phenomena are intelligently designed, or that models of natural phenomena are intelligently designed? To
find out, first read Egnor's whole post at the link above.

There has been a brief discussion of this <a href="https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/rosenhouse-s-blunder-another-nonsensical-mathematical-argument-against-intelligent-design/15156">at Peaceful Science</a> but I think there must be more to say here.

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you look at Ken Ham’s daily Twitter posts like I do, you will see that beyond his usual anti-science spiel and promotion of his “Museum” and Ark Park, he is obsessed with complaining about Disney while simultaneously comparing his inane tourist sites to Disney. He also makes lots of posts about LGBTQ issues, especially those concerning transsexuals. Transsexuals are one of Ken’s big bugaboos and his posts indicate he thinks about them often. In any case, a Facebook post by Ken (below the fold) may indicate he is in trouble on Twitter (especially in France and Germany).</p>

<p>Note that his account says he and Answers in Genesis are on various right-wing sites including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler">Parler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeWe">MeWe</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettr">Gettr</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)">Gab</a>. Considering Ham and AiG’s claims to be anti-racist, one of the few things praiseworthy about him and his AiG ministry, this association with these right-wing social media is remarkable. Each of these sites caters to vile, extremist hate groups that have limited access to other social media. Facebook has reprehensible content, but at least Facebook claims to attempt to keep the worst off. Twitter is almost as bad, but seems slightly more responsible in removing the worst posts, at least for the time being. These other sites are replete with racism, Q’Anon, anti-Semitism, anti-vaxx, and numerous other dumbfery. See the Wikipedia links above for further information about these far-right social media organizations Ham and AiG participate in.</p>

<p>Three tweets below the fold; it appears that Germany did not find the tweet actionable.</p>
