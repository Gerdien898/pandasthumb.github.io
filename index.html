        <p>It’s always a risky game to predict what the Supreme Court will do about anything, but we can always discern the general trends, and as a decades-long member of the (spooky, scary!) Federalist Society, I thought I’d take a crack at answering the first three of Joe Felsenstein’s questions about the future of teaching evolution.</p>
<p>
<em>What would this court do if asked to decide a case similar to the Dover School Board case?</em>
<p>
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District"><em>the Dover case</em></a> — which, believe it or not, is going on 20 years ago, now — the district court found that the school board violated the First Amendment by adopting an “Intelligent Design Policy.” This policy required that a statement be read to students in ninth grade biology class which said that biological evolution “is not a fact,” that it contained “gaps ... for which there is no evidence,” and that “Intelligent Design ... differs from Darwin’s view.” It encouraged students to consult <em>Of Pandas and People</em>, a book which advocated ID creationism, and which was made available to students. After a thorough trial on the factual issues, the court found this unconstitutional using two different legal tests: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorsement_test">“Endorsement Test”</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_v._Kurtzman#Lemon_test">“Lemon test.”</a> 
<p>
These tests are intellectual devices judges use to answer whether government has crossed the constitutional lines that bar it from either establishing a religion — that is, creating an official church or creed of some kind — or inhibiting the free exercise of religion — that is, punishing or burdening someone for practicing a faith. And these two tests are quite similar. The Lemon test, however, is a three-part analysis dating back to the 1971 case of <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman</em>. The Endorsement Test is somewhat older.

<p>
The shocking-but-not-surprising decision of the U.S. Supreme Court today raises many questions.  Even setting aside the
issues in the case, there are interesting questions that arise.  Here are some that puzzle me:
<p>
<ol>
<li> What would this court do if asked to decide a case similar to the Dover School Board case?</li>
<li> Would all lower courts rule against such a school board, with the case appealed to the Supreme
Court?</li>
<li> Or would the increasing number of conservative justices who have been vetted by the Federalist 
Society allow the Supreme Court to dodge such an issue by letting the pro-ID or pro-creationism
ruling of an appeals court stand, by refusing to hear the case?</li>
<li> How soon can we expect the Discovery Institute to lawyer-up and decide that its original position of
"Teach The Controversy" is maybe not such a bad approach after all?</li>
<li> What's the latest on threats to the teaching of evolution in countries where ultraconservative
nationalist movements are in power or nearing it?  Hungary? Poland? Russia? Turkey? Brazil? India?</li>
<li> In countries such as Australia or Canada where there are more conservative and less conservative
provinces, what local controversies are there about the teaching of evolution?</li>
<li>Will evaluating the flaws in arguments against evolutionary biology have any effect
on legal or political decisions?</li></ol>
<p>
Discuss. I suspect that there is enough to 
discuss without going around in endless circles in the same old abortion rights debate.

        <p>On June 13, I received an invitation to publish in what was obviously a predatory paleontology journal. (The “Assistant Managing Editor” incorrectly assumed I have a doctorate (I don’t)).</p>

        <p><strong>A response to the evangelical Discovery Institute (and others)</strong></p>

<figure class="on-the-left-side" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">

<p>The Discovery Institute, principal advocate of the Intelligent Design (ID) movement in the US, attempts to invalidate scientific results demonstrating that so-called <i>irreducibly complex (IC)</i> biological traits can evolve naturally. According to the ID protagonist Michael Behe (1996), a system is <i>by definition</i> irreducibly complex if it consists of several specifically interacting components which together produce a function such that the removal of any single component leads to the failure of this function. Most biochemical systems are irreducibly complex in that sense. Since they cannot be less complex without losing their function, unguided natural processes based on random mutations and selection cannot build them up gradually, according to Behe. Instead, multiple coordinated mutations would be required <i>simultaneously</i>.</p>

<p>Behe postulates that a stepwise evolution of such systems is too improbable to have happened if more than two coordinated mutations, two specific binding sites among proteins, or two specific interdependencies between the parts of a system were established in one fell swoop. Such systems are beyond the “edge of evolution,” Behe says, and need an intelligent creator. This is the so-called <i>argument from irreducible complexity</i> (IC argument).</p>

<p>However, within the last 25 years, ID advocates were faced with more and more logical arguments and empirical data which made apparent that their perception of how evolution works is untenable. One intriguing example is the evolution of a mitochondrial gene in the corn plant <i>Zea mays</i> named <i>T-URF13</i> which encodes a ligand-gated pore forming receptor protein called URF13 protein (Hunt 2007).</p>
