        <p>I was forwarded a press release from Answers in Genesis the other day. They tout a new addition to their collection, a giant palm frond:</p>

<figure class="on-the-left-side" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 40px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">

<figcaption>Giant palm frond on display at Ark Park. <small> Credit: AIG press release.</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote><p>"Meanwhile, the Ark Encounter continues to make major additions. On the third deck of the massive ship [sic], a large exhibit highlighting a giant plant fossil is now on display. This unique 10’7” palm frond fossil was discovered in the well-known Green River Formation of Wyoming. </p>  
 
<p>"Dr. Andrew Snelling, head of the research department at AiG, declared: 'It is a phenomenal, world-class fossil. It is not millions of years old. The palm frond was buried catastrophically as a result of the global flood of Noah’s day about 4,500 years ago.' A family in Wisconsin made the fossil’s donation possible." </p> </blockquote>

<p>The palm frond, we note, is in very good condition for something that was buried catastrophically.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Green River Shale fossils are actually common and well-studied, so this display isn’t hurting scientific research as badly as the <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2015/06/will-aig-return.html"><i>Allosaurus</i> specimen they received from the neo-Confederate Michael Peroutka</a>.  Magnificent specimens like these are very expensive. This one was probably prepared by the <a href="https://www.greenriverstone.com/">Green River Stone Company</a>, a commercial excavator and preparation company that is concerned exclusively with making sales (one of many problems with the commercial fossil market; sales do not necessarily benefit scientific research).  Ham’s Wisconsin donors must have deep pockets. I hope the donors and the costs are revealed on a future AiG or Crosswater Canyon IRS Form 990. I will be looking.</p>

<p>In the previous post, I argued that modern-day critics of the Modern Evolutionary 
Synthesis who think that they are putting forth a Lamarckian theory most likely
aren’t doing that, as they do not actually believe that the direction of change 
toward adaptation comes from use and disuse of organs.  To Lamarck, the 
directionality was not due to external environmental effects being inherited, 
it was actually the effort made by the individual to use particular organs more or use them 
less that somehow altered its genetic makeup and it was those changes that were inherited.</p>

<p>And now comes Dennis Noble.  A leader of the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis 
group and one of the main organizers of the notorious 2016 meeting on New Trends 
in Evolutionary Biology brought about by misguided biologists, philosophers, and
historians who talked the Royal Society into endorsing it, he has published 
another outburst.</p>

<p>Noble, an eminent physiologist, points to exosome vesicles that can cross the 
barrier between the somatic cells and the germ cells in animals, ones that can
contain mRNA.  These, he argues, can serve as the basis for the effects of use 
and disuse to alter the herditary material.  He does not actually show that this 
is what they do.  A critical issue is whether the effects on the somatic cells 
then induce in the germ cells a genetic change that is adaptive.</p>

<p>But don’t listen to me.  Jerry Coyne has lost his temper and published a 
critique at his blog <em>Why Evolution Is True</em>. He tears strips off Noble in a rather 
disrespectful way.  Which seems to me to be appropriate.  When Jerry gets into 
a high Evolutionary Synthesis dudgeon, he is well worth reading.  You will 
find his piece <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/08/07/denis-noble-goes-after-darwinian-evolution-again-scores-own-goal/"><strong>here</strong></a>.  Noble’s original cri de couer was published  <a href="https://iai.tv/articles/denis-noble-the-broken-paradigm-of-neo-darwinism-auid-2210"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

        <p>Happy birthday, Jean-Baptiste!  On this day, August 1, in 1744 Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, the Chevalier de Lamarck, was born.  Had he lived he would now be a sprightly 
278 years old.  It is time for my annual birthday post.  He was the first evolutionary biologist.  In addition to world-class work in invertebrate taxonomy he argued for common descent and put forward a mechanism to account for adaptation.  No not inheritance of acquired characters – everyone always knew that it was true.  The mechanism was Use and Disuse. Organisms tried to solve their problems by using (or disusing) their organs, and the resulting changes would be adaptive and of course would be passed on to the next generation.  Lamarck also believed that,
in addition, there was an overall force in descent of organisms in nature leading to an increase of complexity.</p>

<p>Is Lamarckism dead now?  Well, yes and no.  Let me explain …</p>

This creature entered the house and was very kindly walking on a glass window when I snapped this picture. Mark Sturtevant tells me, "There are statements that if it has isolated black spots on the abdomen, like this one does, then it's a queen. Queens commonly turn up in houses early in the season or late in the season as they wind up in there when seeking shelter to overwinter."

<p>Dismissals of evolutionary biology have come at such a pace lately that we need at least a monthly report on how the previous month’s evolutionary theory has been overthrown. I hope that this can 
be a regular feature.  I figure that once a month is about 
right, as there are enough overthrows of evolutionary theory to
supply it.  Well, actually I hope that there will be no
need for such a series, but alas …</p>

<p>This month we report on two such events:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The hoatzin, a silly-looking bird that looks like a confused
chicken, is hard to place on the phylogeny of birds.  An 
article in <em>The New Yorker</em> suggests that this may discredit
the very notion of a phylogeny.  That in turn has led to comments
by many of the usual suspects.  One of the major scientific papers on
bird phylogeny has as an author our own John Harshman.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A survey of new discoveries in evolutionary biology appeared
in <em>The Guardian</em>.  Its author called for existing
evolutionary theory to be tossed out and for it to be replaced
by the thinking of the supporters of the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis.  The piece has been welcomed by creationists and
advocates of ID, and criticized by pro-evolution websites.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>“Below the fold” you will find some more details and links.  Will
the new paradigms still be around a month from now?</p>
