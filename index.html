        <p><i>WWU’s Huxley College of the Environment may be renamed after a bizarre report uncritically plagiarising far-right creationist &amp; conspiracist materials gets Thomas Henry Huxley exactly backwards on racism.</i></p>

<p>From 2004-2007 Dr. Nick Matzke worked at the National Center for Science Education, including the Kitzmiller v. Dover court case that determined that teaching “intelligent design” in public schools was unconstitutional. He obtained his Ph.D. in Integrative Biology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2013. He is now a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland. This essay represents his personal scholarly views, not those of current or former employers.&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Western Washington University’s <a href="https://huxley.wwu.edu/">Huxley College of the Environment</a> was founded in 1969, the year of the Santa Barbara oil spill, when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire, and when Earth Day was proposed. It is now one of the oldest and most prestigious environmental colleges in the country. It was named for Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895), famed not only as “Darwin’s Bulldog” after the 1859 publication of the Origin of Species, but also for his remarkable career, rising from a family too poor to pay for school to becoming a leading anatomist (proposing the kinship of humans with the great apes, and birds with dinosaurs), geologist, ethnologist, and philosopher (coiner of the word “agnostic,” foe of Social Darwinism). Above all he was a leading figure in making science a profession (rather than a hobby for priests and the landed gentry), and making a liberal science education available to all.</p>

<p>Despite accomplishing more than most could ever dream for science and public science education, Huxley is now in the dock at WWU. The main charge is racism, with many at WWU calling for Huxley College to be renamed. WWU’s president commissioned a <a href="https://president.wwu.edu/research-and-resources">Legacy Review Task Force</a> which issued a <a href="https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-07/LRTF%20Report%20and%20Recommendations_June%202021.pdf">Report</a> making the rather elliptical claim that Huxley’s “ethnological accomplishments were grounded in white supremacist values that dehumanize and harm many members of the Western community.” More directly, the Report indicts him for advocating polygenism (the idea that different human races are separate species) and “many negative generalizations on the basis of race.” Another charge was that Huxley’s “Huxley’s claims about the inexhaustibility of fisheries has contributed to the decline of the salmon runs that are central to Coast Salish cultures.”</p>

<p>Are the accusations correct? A large debate could be had about the substantial difficulties of fully understanding the views of historical figures, let alone judging them. But clearly universities should not ignore major relevant evidence, nor rely on badly biased and one-sided presentations of the evidence.</p>

<p>I shared the excitement when I read <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3">here</a> that “in ~ 1650 BCE (~ 3600 years ago), a cosmic airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam, a Middle-Bronze-Age city in the southern Jordan Valley northeast of the Dead Sea,” and that this event could have given rise to the biblical account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Somewhat to my surprise, Ken Ham of <i>Answers in Genesis</i> did not. I now think that Ken’s conclusion [1] was right and I was wrong.<br /></p>

<p>Like I suspect many of the journalists and interested readers who swooped on this story, I failed at first to notice that the paper was not, despite the link, an article in <i>Nature</i> but in <i>Scientific Reports</i>. This is one of the stable of second-line journals closely linked to <i>Nature</i> being published by Springer, now controlled by the publishing giant Hotlzbrinck, and profiting from <i>Nature</i>’s reputation for excellence. I was only vaguely aware of the authors’ long history of invoking airbursts, took the many kinds of evidence listed at face value, and did not even blink at the claim that “[a]n airburst-related influx of salt (~ 4 wt.%) produced hypersalinity,” a process for which I can envisage no credible mechanism.</p>

<p>I have not read Stephen Meyer’s new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G122JJN/">Return of the God Hypothesis</a>, subtitled “Three Scientific Discoveries That Reveal the Mind Behind the Universe,” and possibly will not. I had not been aware that the God hypothesis had ever gone away, and 700-odd pages of what looks like old hat seems perhaps a bit excessive.</p>

<p>Fortunately, what may look to some like an unlikely source, the right-wing blog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(website)">Ricochet</a>, may have saved me the trouble: They recently ran a splendid “<a href="https://ricochet.com/1059644/stephen-meyers-return-of-the-god-hypothesis/">critique</a>” of the book by <a href="https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1535406429/clearer-thinking-with-spencer-greenberg/liberalism-and-conservatism-with-cassandra-xia-and-hank-racette">Henry Racette</a>.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Racette, the book stands on three pillars:</p>

<p><i>Guest post by <strong>Dan Phelps</strong>, to whom we are indebted for unearthing this whopper from Answers in Genesis:</i><br /></p>

<p>Once again, creationists are misrepresenting a recent dinosaur discovery. This time it is a large carcharodontosaur from Uzbekistan that was recently described in a paper, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210923">A new carcharodontosaurian theropod dinosaur occupies apex predator niche in the early Late Cretaceous of Uzbekistan</a>, by Kohei Tanaka and colleagues from the universities of Tsukuba, Hokkaido, and Calgary.<br /></p>

<p>On today’s “Answers News,” an online news video by Answers in Genesis, their employees (including Ken Ham’s son-in-law, Bodie Hodge) discuss this dinosaur. The discussion can be found from about 9 minutes, 30 seconds to about 14 minutes in <a href="https://youtu.be/4Jhf2eKXwAc">this</a> YouTube video.  As is par for the course, they ignore the actual publication and rely instead on popular press discussions such as <a href="https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2021/9/9/22664700/tyrannosaurus-rex-ulughbegsaurus-uzbekistanensis-bigger-dinosaur">this one</a> . They also add their bizarre creationist interpretations and claim the fossil was buried in Noah’s Flood. <br /></p>

<p>Even more ridiculously, they suggest the theropod dinosaur – the apex predator! – may have been a vegetarian. This would be amusing except that AIG is misinforming children and adults via such broadcasts as above, the Creation “Museum,” and their Kentucky-taxpayer–subsidized “Ark Encounter.”</p>
