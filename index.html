        <p>For readers who have not been following this controversy, I thought I would point out Jerry Coyne’s article on <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/12/13/new-zealand-authorities-stand-firm-in-desire-to-teach-maori-ways-of-knowing-alongside-science-in-high-schools-and-colleges/"> New Zealand’s intention to teach Maori “ways of knowing”</a> alongside science in schools and universities. Dr. Coyne has been following the situation for some time now, but the article I cite, his latest as of now, provides a good summary.</p>

<p>The scare quotes (“ways of knowing”) are Dr. Coyne’s, but to my mind they are entirely justified. True, the Maori and other indigenous peoples have learned a great deal about their environments, but much of what they “know” is palpably untrue. Indeed, many indigenous peoples, including the ancient Hebrews, tell what are essentially creationist myths and are therefore demonstrably false. These myths are also generally mutually exclusive. They may be appropriate in anthropology or history classes, but they are not science and do not belong in a science class, except conceivably alongside phlogiston in a unit on the history of science.</p>

<p>The New Zealand policy, though obviously well-intentioned, is frankly pandering. It leads to the following question: Must we teach Iroquois “ways of knowing” in New York, Navajo “ways of knowing” in New Mexico, and astrology in Boulder, Colorado – and all as science?</p>

        <p>At 3 pm on Thursday, December 9, 2021, the Western Washington University Board of Directors is having a final hearing on the proposed de-naming of the Huxley College of the Environment. In a late twist, the Board has apparently abandoned its earlier Legacy Review Task Force Report on Huxley, presumably after all of the historical mistake and distortions were pointed out. Instead, it commissioned a last-minute “<a href="https://trustees.wwu.edu/meeting-materials">Ad Hoc Committee Report</a>”, which retreats on most of the anti-Huxley claims, and semi-acknowledges Huxley’s numerous progressive achievements, but in the end still recommends de-naming Huxley because, it judges, student perceptions trump context and truth.</p>

<p>This all matters, because the WWU fight is pretty clearly an initial skirmish in a debate that will continue with the proposed denaming of the Huxley Building at Imperial College London, and other Huxley awards, lectures, and Darwiniana.  Win or lose at WWU, it is important to develop and publicize the evidence and arguments against this kind of thing. What is at stake? Huxley, Darwin, and a great number of other progressive reformers who helped enlighten our society, and, frankly, who helped to develop our modern anti-racist views, will be wiped from the public sphere.</p>

<p>Updated: Creationists and advocates of social justice unite to take down T.H. Huxley, a leader in educational inclusion

<p><b>Text (5 minutes to read):</b></p>

<p>Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak. My name is Nick Matzke, I am a Senior Lecturer in Biology at the University of Auckland, but until recently my whole career was in the USA. I am interested in society’s treatment of Thomas Henry Huxley because I have worked in the fields of science education and evolutionary science for almost 20 years. Part of that work involved the 2005 <i>Kitzmiller v. Dover</i> trial, where I discovered the creationist ancestry of the so-called “intelligent design” movement, promoted by the Discovery Institute of Seattle.</p>

<p>Huxley is an inspiration for me as the original public advocate for science, science education, and science-informed liberalism.</p>

<p>It is perhaps a caricature to claim that conservatives think all inequality is genetic, so there is nothing we can do about it. It is probably less of a caricature to claim that liberals think no inequality is genetic, so all we have to worry about is environmental. At least one purpose of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genetic-Lottery-Matters-Social-Equality/dp/0691190801">The Genetic Lottery</a> by Kathryn Paige Harden, Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, is apparently to convince liberals that people’s differing genetic inheritances may contribute to inequality (see also a &lt;a href=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/can-progressives-be-convinced-that-genetics-matters&gt;profile of the author&lt;/a&gt; by Gideon Lewis-Krauss in <i>The New Yorker</i>).</p>

<p>I do not know why liberals and minority groups (they are overlapping sets) are afraid of research linking, for example, genes and intelligence, but I can guess along with Dr. Harden that it is related to their justifiable fear of eugenics. Comparing Dr. Harden’s work to eugenics is a bit like conflating nuclear power with nuclear bombs; it is right to be afraid of one, but not necessarily the other, and certainly not to be afraid of one because of the other.</p>

<p>Dr. Harden’s book is in two parts: “Taking Genetics Seriously” and “Taking Equality Seriously.” The first is a mostly scientific discussion of the relation between genes and various traits such as intelligence, which she claims partly determine your income and status. I found it a useful primer. The second part is more political and cries for mostly unspecified actions designed to increase the status of those who may be tacitly discriminated against because of a poor genetic inheritance.</p>

William Dembski summarizes the status of ID (link to YouTube video is below)</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Discovery Institute had released a YouTube video of William Dembski’s 30-minute talk last March at the
DI’s Dallas Conference on Science and Faith.  This conference, whose other talks have not yet been made
available, was supposed to occur on February 20 but was postponed until March 13 and made into mostly a virtual
conference.  There was an in-person gathering at the Denton Bible Church, and Dembski’s
talk looks like it was in-person.  The
other speakers were Marcos Eberlin, Stephen Meyer, Casey Luskin, and Melissa Cain Travis.</p>

<p>The interest in this talk is mainly in what he describes as the current state of the Intelligent
Design movement.  He feels that its intellectual arguments have been a substantial success, but
that society has mostly not been persuaded to accept them.</p>

<p>You will find the Youtube video of his 30-minute talk on “Gauging the Success of Intelligent
Design” <a href="https://youtu.be/mDD7pARRfm4"><strong>here</strong></a>.   Take a look.  The talk is only 30 minutes
long.  Which arguments does he consider to be valid?  The part about how successful ID
has been starts 20 minutes in, but there is much before that that illuminates his
perspective …</p>
