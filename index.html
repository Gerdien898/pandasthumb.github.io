        <figure><figcaption> The left-handed DNA helix model that was displayed in the Seattle World's Fair ended up in storage
in a utility tunnel underneath the Pacific Science Center.  (We'll show the image here as soon as we get
permission to show it on this page.)  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PacSci/photos/pcb.10152437776723855/10152437771508855/">This link</a> shows the image on the PSC Facebook page.</figcaption></figure>

<p>On January 11, Matt Young reported that the Institute for Creation Science announced a new log that depicting left-handed DNA. Although regularly occurring in vivo in the form of Z-DNA left-handed DNA only represent a very tiny proportion of the word’s DNA which consists predominantly of right-handed B-DNA as Watson and Crick described it in their 1954 paper.</p>

<p>The ICR left-handed DNA logo made it on the pages of <a href="https://users.fred.net/tds/leftdna/">Tom Schneider’s Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame</a> immediately and became the sites first entry in 2022.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Institute for Creation Research has created a new logo representing their support for left handed DNA research and the ongoing takeover! First reported on 2022 Jan 11, new as of 2022 Jan 112</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most cases depicting DNA left-handed will be caused by mirroring a correct picture to better suit design purposes or likely more often by copying publicly available pictures. The same may be true for the ICR logo. Still, the incident reminded me of the likely first ever publicly displayed left-handed DNA model that was part of the Science Exhibition at the Seattle World Fair in 1962 which I came across when I studied the history of a right-handed DNA model Max Delbrück purchased for the Institute of Genetics of the University of Cologne.</p>

<p>When is evolution not evolution?  When it's described by creationist/ID sources and is
obviously change effected by selection.  Case in point: any form of selection resulting
from human activity.  On January 27, 2022 the ever-astonishing Denyse O’Leary (“News” at the anti-evolution
website Uncommon Descent) made <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/are-humans-changing-evolution/#comments"><strong>a post</strong></a> in which she linked to an article
on BBC Future by David Farrier.  He starts out by saying that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humans have shaped the bodies of other creatures at least since dogs were domesticated around
30,000 years ago. But the combination of industrialised farming, introduced species,
urbanisation, pollution, and climate change are creating unprecedented selective pressures. We
have become the world's greatest evolutionary force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Farrier’s post, which you will find
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220125-how-humans-are-changing-evolution"><strong>here</strong></a>
gives numerous examples of ways humans are accidentally, or deliberately, influencing
evolution.</p>

<p>The statement looks straightforward, but News will have none of it.  Her response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a human-dominated world, things happen faster, for better or worse. Should we still call
it “evolution” if we did it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, her answer is no, and the UD commenters all applaud this. But they’re all wrong.</p>

        <p>I will keep this short, but I wanted to call attention to two <i>Science</i> articles on E.O. Wilson, who died on Dec. 26 and, I think, needs no introduction.  First: an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9848">obituary</a> by Stuart Pimm of Duke University and an expert on conservation biology. Second: an <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2335">editorial</a> by H. Holden Thorp, the editor of <i>Science</i>. Dr. Pimm in particular notes Wilson’s assertion that natural selection might actually select for human behaviors and observed that he was attacked for this view, sometimes unfairly. Both articles were pleasant and made me wish I had met Wilson, rather than just read a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Naturalist-Edward-Wilson-ebook/dp/B009LO4796">memoir</a> of his.</p>

<p>The attacks have not stopped, and on December 29, before Wilson’s body was metaphorically cold, <i>Scientific American</i> published a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-complicated-legacy-of-e-o-wilson/">hatchet job</a> by a nursing professor, <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/monica.mclemore">Monica McLemore</a> of the University of California, San Francisco. You may read a detailed critique of Dr. McLemore’s paper, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/12/30/scientific-american-does-an-asinine-hit-job-on-e-o-wilson-calling-him-a-racist/">Scientific American does an asinine hit job on E. O. Wilson, calling him a racist</a>, by Jerry Coyne, who does not mince his words, even in a title.</p>

<p>According to Google Scholar, Dr. McLemore is an author or coauthor of a fair number of papers in scientific journals (she says, “81 peer reviewed articles, OpEds and commentaries,” as well as being cited here and there, but only journal articles count). She is thus supposedly a competent researcher. Yet her article said barely a word about Wilson and accused even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4707027/">Gregor Mendel</a> of racism, though how she might know that is beyond me. I should have stopped reading then and there.</p>

<p>When I was in graduate school, during the Vietnam war, we listened as an earnest young medical resident told about his project to find the psychological causes of war. One of my friends told him, “If you set out to find the psychological causes of war, you will surely find them.” The point was not lost on the resident. I think likewise that if you set out to find racism in science, you will surely find it. Even where it does not exist.</p>

<p>The author of this interesting <a href="https://www.ivpress.com/the-genealogical-adam-and-eve">book</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Joshua_Swamidass">S. Joshua Swamidass</a>, posits that the scientific evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that we could all be descended from a single couple who lived in comparatively recent times, say, 10,000 years or so ago. The conventional wisdom is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve">Mitochondrial Eve</a>, the most recent matrilineal common ancestor of all people alive today, and Y-Chromosomal Adam, our most recent patrilineal common ancestor, lived at very different times 100,000 or more years ago and so could not have been a couple. Dr. Swamidass, an MD, holds a PhD in information science, and is an associate professor at Washington University in St Louis. He is the real McCoy, not someone who has quit to shill for Answers in Genesis, Reasons to Believe, or Aish HaTorah, and must be taken seriously.</p>

<p>The full title of the book is <i>The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science of Universal Ancestry</i>. In it, the author makes a distinction between your <i>genealogical</i> ancestry and your <i>genetic</i> ancestry. He notes that your genes are diluted from one generation to the next, so that eventually people who are in fact your descendants will very probably have none of your genes. I think of it as diluting a solution over and over again: eventually, none of the solute will remain in the solvent, because the solute is not infinitely continuous but rather is made up of atoms or molecules. Once the last solute molecule is gone, the concentration is 0. In the same way, your genes (or your genetic inheritance) are not continuous, and once the last gene is gone, your descendants inherit none of your DNA. (When I read this account, I was reminded of T.H. Huxley’s lament after having read <i>On the Origin of Species</i>: <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that</a>.)</p>
