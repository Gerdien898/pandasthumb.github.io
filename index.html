<p>A geranium plant that I supposedly take care of has a serious infestation with whiteflies. Before dousing the plant with insecticidal soap (a procedure I am supposed to follow every week for a while), I snapped the preceding picture. There is a lot of there there, so I asked Mark Sturtevant exactly what I am looking at. His response:</p>

<blockquote><p>The spiky things are a weird part of the life cycle of whiteflies. Although they are in the order Hemiptera, which are 'supposed' to have <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/incomplete-metamorphosis/">incomplete metamorphosis</a> (passing thru nymphal stages before molting into adults), whiteflies are hemipterans that essentially have a larval stage and pupal stage of <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/complete-metamorphosis/">holometabolous</a> insects.</p>

<p>You can see quite a bit going on here in this one picture. I have re-attached your picture with some annotations.</p> 

<p>I don't know if there are eggs in view. The tiny white specks look more like glandular secretions from the leaf. But there are a few larvae along the top border of the picture, and I have marked some with an L.  You see the pupal stage already (one is marked with a P), but technically these are <a href="https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/puparium/">puparia</a>. When a larva becomes a pupa, the larva usually sheds its cuticle to show the pupa underneath, with its own cuticle. But in whiteflies (and in some other insects like flies and fleas), the larva does not shed its cuticle. Rather, it puffs it out, hardens it, and the pupal stage stays locked inside the larval cuticle. That outer larval shell is called the puparium. Then there are the adults. The large adults are females, and I have marked one with an F. Males are smaller and much more active. Winged males fly and seek out females. I think the one labelled M is a male.</p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the day was warm, and there were lots of males on the window trying to get out.</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Sturtevant about the transparent spheres that clutter the frame:</p>

<blockquote>I don't know what the big spheres are, but it could be like aphids (whiteflies are related to them) which periodically secrete a drop of honeydew. This is excess water from plant sap, and aphids secrete that to concentrate the nutrients. Since whiteflies are always secreting a waxy bloom, a thin wax coating on their honeydew droplets would hold them together. That's a hypothesis, but I don't really know. </blockquote>

<p>Imperial College has decided not to rename the Huxley Building, in a partial victory for those who oppose “canceling” historical figures who held views that today are properly regarded as racist. Instead, according to an article, <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/234096/imperial-commits-ambitious-understanding-history/">Imperial commits to ‘ambitious understanding’ of history</a>, by Deborah Evanson, they will add a second, joint name to the building, in addition to that of Thomas H. Huxley. The second name will be that of “a pathbreaking scientist from a Black, Asian or other minority ethnic background.” The College will also retain a bust of Huxley, but will put Huxley and his accomplishments</p>

<blockquote>into a fuller context in order to provide everyone with a more complete understanding of Huxley’s complex character and achievements as well as his flaws, including his racially prejudiced writings. Historical context will also be provided for any person whose name is added jointly.  </blockquote>

<p>Huxley, like most of us, was indeed a complex character. He no doubt thought that white, male Englishmen were generally smarter than everyone else. In that respect he was no different from most white, male Englishmen of his time. Nevertheless, according to <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/12/Matzke-Huxley-comments.html">an article by Nick Matzke and others</a> on Panda’s Thumb last December, Huxley devoted himself to educating women and poor people, and actively opposed slavery; he was thus well in advance of many, if not most, of his contemporaries. It is gratifying that Imperial College recognizes this progressive leader and has decided not to dename the Huxley Building because of a flaw that was widely shared in his era.</p>

<p>The biologist and blogger Jerry Coyne calls the compromise “<a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2022/02/25/a-small-victory-thomas-henry-huxley-not-cancelled-but-contextualized-at-imperial-college/">a small victory</a>,” and I suppose it is. Huxley did not fare so well at Western Washington University, where his name was removed from the Huxley College of the Environment; see the preceding link for more background.</p>

<p>On Friday, February 18, I attended (on Zoom) a fascinating seminar given by <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/p-kilmartin">Paul Kilmartin, Professor of Chemistry</a> in the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-chemical-sciences.html">School of Chemical Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html">University of Auckland</a>, here in Aotearoa/New Zealand. (<a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/nmat471">I work</a> in the <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-biological-sciences.html">School of Biological Sciences</a> at the same institution.) Prof. Kilmartin specialises in wine chemistry, among other things, and in addition to chemistry, has degrees in theology and philosophy.</p>

<p>Kilmartin’s talk was entitled <b>“Chemistry and Mātauranga Māori: A Conversation.”</b> Kilmartin has given me permission to quote this part of his talk, below, which covers science education material of international interest. I will also include the talk summary. Other parts of Kilmartin’s seminar focused on his own background coming to this issue (Scottish and Māori ancestry, member of <a href="https://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/">Ngāi Tahu</a>, deep knowledge of Ngāi Tahu history and land claims), and ideas for Auckland’s chemistry program to explore regarding mātauranga Māori.</p>

<p>The Panda’s Thumb blog has an international readership interested in science and science education, and I have been involved with science education controversies for 20 years (and with PT for 18!). But I’m sure the NZ situation is new to many readers. Therefore, I will give some background/introduction to the controversy around the science curriculum, after the quote from Kilmartin’s talk.  For more (much more) on current science education controversies in New Zealand, please search <a href="https://news.google.com/search?q=science%2C%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;hl=en-NZ&amp;gl=NZ&amp;ceid=NZ%3Aen">Google News</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=science%20%20M%C4%81tauranga%20M%C4%81ori&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/?s=mauri+zealand&amp;orderby=relevance&amp;order=DESC&amp;post_type=post">blogs</a> etc. on the various terms mentioned.</p>

<p><i>(Please not that all of non-talk material is written by me, and should not necessarily be taken as Kilmartin’s views. And, these are my personal views, not those of current or former employers.)</i></p>

        <p>This is perhaps slightly off-topic, but we have not heard from the neo-Confederate and one-time secessionist <a href="http://americanloons.blogspot.com/2014/05/1022-michael-peroutka.html">Michael Peroutka</a> in a long time, not since he <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/05/dinosaur-fossil.html">donated a dinosaur fossil to the Creation "Museum"</a> or <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2014/11/michael-peroutk.html">was elected to the Anne Arundel County Council in Maryland</a>. According to an <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-peroutka-ag-20220202-x6lcsbwfynaordddshodb7tlt4-story.html">article</a> by Pamela Wood in yesterday’s  <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, he now plans a run for Attorney General of Maryland. As we noted in 2014,</p>
<blockquote>… Michael Peroutka until recently was also a board member of the League of the South, a white supremacist, neo-Confederate and pro-secessionist organization that has been <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/league-south">named a hate group</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center. </blockquote>

<p>Let us hope that the citizens of Maryland show more discernment than the citizens of Anne Arundel County.</p>
