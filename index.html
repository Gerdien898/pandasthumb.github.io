<p>An observant reader sent us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aigkenham/photos/4898302493533401">this picture</a>, which was the subject of a tweet by Ken Ham of AIG, and noted that the caption should have been</p>

<p><strong><big>"Fired because my beliefs endangered the health and safety of others."&lt;/strong&gt;</big>&lt;/p&gt;

<p>He further commented,</p>

<blockquote><p>Seriously, it doesn't bother AiG to fire or not to hire people because they don't believe what the organization requires (this behavior is legal under the Civil Rights Act, BTW, if carefully structured). SO why do they take such umbrage when someone else does the same thing?</p> 

<p>And, there certainly is a clear and present danger to acting on these [anti-vaccination] beliefs, whereas I would be hard pressed to find such a danger among, say, other Christian denominations that do not follow the bizarre twists that AiG insists on. </p></blockquote><p>You may read about First Liberty Institute (mentioned in the figure) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Liberty_Institute">here</a>.

</figure>
<p>This splendid picture by Paul Strode shows a white rainbow, or a fog bow. The white rainbow is seen when the droplets are very small, as in a fog. In that case the angle of diffraction is at least much as the angle of refraction, so the colors overlap, and the rainbow appears white. M. Minnaert, in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Light-Colour-Dover-Sciences/dp/0486201961/">The nature of light and color in the open air</a> (&#167;128), notes that the width of the white rainbow may be as much as twice the width of the ordinary rainbow. Additionally, the colors may be reversed, because red light is diffracted more than blue, whereas it is refracted less. In Dr. Strode's picture, we see a "conventional" rainbow at the left merging into a white arc where, presumably, the droplets are smaller. The arc is about the same width as the colored section, which hints that the droplets are sized so that diffraction barely covers refraction. In consequence, we do not see any color, reversed or otherwise.</p>

<p>Incidentally, contrary to popular descriptions <a href="https://www.popsci.com/where-do-white-rainbows-come-from/">here</a> and (especially) <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/holidays-entertaining/entertaining/seasonal-events/white-rainbow">there</a>, the light is always refracted by the droplets, but sometimes diffraction plays a role as well.</p>

<p>The ever-astonishing site Evolution News and Science Today has astonished once again.  Finding a paper in the
scientific literature which provides evidence for a horizontal gene transfer event, they declare that
this shows that <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/11/case-study-inadvertently-shows-why-universal-common-descent-is-untestable/">common descent is an untestable
concept</a></p>

<p>The paper is in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msab317/6420225">Citrullination was introduced into animals by horizontal gene transfer from
cyanobacteria</a>  (Disclosure: I have
published in that journal, and served as President of its parent society).</p>

<p>The paper straightforwardly provides evidence from molecular phylogenies and functional studies that the enzyme
peptidylarginine deaminase has a distribution discordant with the overall phylogeny of life, in that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The animal and cyanobacterial PADI proteins share functionally relevant primary and tertiary synapomorphic sequences
that are distinct from a second PADI type present in fungi and actinobacteria …. The consilience of evidence
indicates that PADIs were introduced from cyanobacteria into animals by horizontal gene transfer (HGT).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aha! exclaims EN&amp;ST. About Universal Common Descent, they note that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>UCD is often held to be testable via the counterfactual of “genes and proteins might have been discovered in
 groups where they should not exist”. In other words, if we observed genes and proteins occurring in the TOL,
 with unequivocal homology to the same sequences found elsewhere in phylogenetically distant or divergent groups, UCD
 would be in trouble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And indeed they think that horizontal gene transfer is an added assumption that needs to be verified, and that if we
invoke it in this way, UCD is in trouble:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UCD’s big entourage only becomes a problem when its members always pay the fines for UCD’s failed
predictions, pick up UCD’s tab at restaurants and hotels, and generally cover the empirical shortfalls of UCD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and they end with the declaration that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If ever anyone needed evidence of the
untestability of UCD, papers like this provide it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The even-more-astonishing Denyse O’Leary (“News” at Uncommon Descent) also <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/darwinism/a-friend-says-this-paper-illustrates-that-universal-common-descent-is-untestable/">made the same point</a>,
attributing it to “a friend”; one of the two of them also seems to be a friend of EN&amp;ST.</p>

<p>As noted in the <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2021/11/updated-creationists-social-justice-advocates-unite-take-down-huxley.html">post on the attempts to can T.H. Huxley</a>, <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/equality/activities/history-group/">Imperial College is proposing to also dename</a> rooms named for R. A. Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane. Fisher has been widely targeted since 2020 (in my view out all proportion of the actual evidence – I agree with <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/210620887?accountid=8424">Stephen Jay Gould</a> (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11612599/">1991</a>) on Fisher, but that is another post). But as a political conservative and eugenicist (although he basically stopped eugenics advocacy in the 1930s, unlike many others), and without a big obvious record of progressive actions, Fisher is a challenge to defend.</p>

<p>Targeting J.B.S. Haldane, of all people, is, well, nuts. Everyone seems to have forgotten that he was a vocal critic of the older eugenics, another reform eugenicist like Julian Huxley, but even further left. Haldane was a literal card-carrying communist and inveterate critic of the classist assumptions of the earlier eugenicists. His far-left views got him in trouble when it came to defending Stalin – Haldane probably was on a lot of lists for cancellation by the right in the 1950s. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/books/review/a-dominant-character-haldane-samanth-subramanian.html"><i> New York Times</i> review</a> of the 2020 biography <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dominant_Character"><i>A Dominant Character: The Radical Science and Restless Politics of J. B. S. Haldane</i></a> says, “British intelligence kept him under surveillance for more than 20 years on the suspicion — probably unfounded — that he was a Soviet spy.”  Haldane’s slowness to criticize Lysenko didn’t make him any friends in the genetics community either.</p>

<p>Haldane was a remarkable individual and progressive in many ways, for example, as a critic of empire (specifically the Suez Crisis of 1956) he moved to India in his later years, something that the Imperial College tribunal tasked with reviewing colonialist legacies at Imperial somehow does not mention. But, I don’t have the bandwidth for a detailed defense of Haldane at the moment.  But I can help in one way.  For many moderns who make judgements based on what’s put in front of them online, preferably in a Twitter post, sources don’t really exist unless they are online, free, and text-searchable by Google.  Haldane’s famous 1938 essay “The Biology of Inequality,” from his book <i>Heredity and Politics</i>, does not appear to be online.  But I dare anyone to read these passages and then present an argument that Haldane is really someone who should be cancelled in the name of social justice.</p>

        <p><i>WWU’s Huxley College of the Environment may be renamed after a bizarre report uncritically plagiarising far-right creationist &amp; conspiracist materials gets Thomas Henry Huxley exactly backwards on racism.</i></p>

<p><i>From 2004-2007 Dr. Nick Matzke worked at the National Center for Science Education, including the <u><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover.html">Kitzmiller v. Dover</a></u> court case that determined that teaching “intelligent design” in public schools was unconstitutional. He obtained his Ph.D. in Integrative Biology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2013. He is now a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland. This essay represents his personal scholarly views, not those of current or former employers.</i></p>

<p><b>Update, November 2021:</b> A similar situation has now broken out at Imperial College, London. A “History Group” review of colonialist legacies at Imperial has decided that the important thing to do is to target a Huxley statue and building, as well as room named for J.B.S. Haldane (apparently for discussing cloning; never mind Haldane’s strong socialism, critique of hardline eugenics, and explicit anti-imperialism). The name “Imperial College” appears to be untouched. An outline and list of “Key Links” has been added, along with various corrections/clarifications.

<strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Western Washington University’s <a href="https://huxley.wwu.edu/">Huxley College of the Environment</a> was founded in 1969, the year of the Santa Barbara oil spill, when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire, and when Earth Day was proposed. It is now one of the oldest and most prestigious environmental colleges in the country. It was named for Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895), famed not only as Darwin’s defender after the 1859 publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i> (<a href="https://www.linnean.org/news/2019/07/01/1st-july-2019-why-there-was-no-darwins-bulldog">“Darwin’s Bulldog” came into use in 1895</a>), but also for his remarkable career, rising from a family too poor to pay for school to becoming a leading anatomist (proposing the kinship of humans with the great apes, and birds with dinosaurs), geologist, ethnologist, and philosopher (coiner of the word “agnostic,” foe of Social Darwinism). Above all he was a leading figure in making science a profession (rather than a hobby for priests and the landed gentry), and making a liberal science education available to all.</p>

<p>Despite accomplishing more than most could ever dream for science and public science education, Huxley is now in the dock at WWU. The main charge is racism, with many at WWU calling for Huxley College to be renamed. WWU’s president commissioned a <a href="https://president.wwu.edu/research-and-resources">Legacy Review Task Force</a> (LRTF) which issued a <a href="https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-07/LRTF%20Report%20and%20Recommendations_June%202021.pdf">Report</a> making the rather elliptical claim that Huxley’s “ethnological accomplishments were grounded in white supremacist values that dehumanize and harm many members of the Western community.” More directly, the Report indicts him for advocating polygenism (the idea that different human races are separate species) and “many negative generalizations on the basis of race.” Another charge was that “Huxley’s claims about the inexhaustibility of fisheries has contributed to the decline of the salmon runs that are central to Coast Salish cultures.”</p>

<p>Are the accusations correct? A large debate could be had about the substantial difficulties of fully understanding the views of historical figures, let alone judging them. But clearly universities should not ignore major relevant evidence, nor rely on badly biased and one-sided presentations of the evidence.</p>
