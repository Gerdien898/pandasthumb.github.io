  <p>
Michael Egnor, by all accounts a talented neurosurgeon, has come up with an extraordinary argument at Evolution News, the Discovery Institute's site where they attempt to excise evolutionary thinking.  His argument, which is aimed at
Jason Rosenhouse's book <em>The Failures of Mathematical Anti-Evolutionism</em>, can be found <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2022/06/rosenhouses-blunder-another-nonsensical-mathematical-argument-against-intelligent-design/">at this link</a>.   Thanks to Jack Krebs for pointing out this extraordinary paragraph, about Jason's analogy to coin-tossing:

<blockquote>
For Rosenhouse’s analogy to point to unintelligent causes — to Darwinian natural selection — he would have to invoke the analogy that we leave a block of silver on a table by itself and wait for it to (by erosion and wind) sculpt itself into 100 coins, each of which would then spontaneously fall off the table, and the coins that landed tails up would then spontaneously (perhaps by earthquakes!) jump back up onto the table and spontaneously fall again, with this mindless but amazingly specific cycle repeating itself until all 100 coins lay heads-up on the floor (and the floor would first have to assemble itself!). This is a fine model of Darwinian natural selection.
</blockquote>

What is Egnor trying to argue?  I think a major issue is, to what does this argument <em>not</em> apply?  Is it arguing that natural phenomena are intelligently designed, or that models of natural phenomena are intelligently designed? To
find out, first read Egnor's whole post at the link above.

There has been a brief discussion of this <a href="https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/rosenhouse-s-blunder-another-nonsensical-mathematical-argument-against-intelligent-design/15156">at Peaceful Science</a> but I think there must be more to say here.

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you look at Ken Ham’s daily Twitter posts like I do, you will see that beyond his usual anti-science spiel and promotion of his “Museum” and Ark Park, he is obsessed with complaining about Disney while simultaneously comparing his inane tourist sites to Disney. He also makes lots of posts about LGBTQ issues, especially those concerning transsexuals. Transsexuals are one of Ken’s big bugaboos and his posts indicate he thinks about them often. In any case, a Facebook post by Ken (below the fold) may indicate he is in trouble on Twitter (especially in France and Germany).</p>

<p>Note that his account says he and Answers in Genesis are on various right-wing sites including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler">Parler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeWe">MeWe</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettr">Gettr</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)">Gab</a>. Considering Ham and AiG’s claims to be anti-racist, one of the few things praiseworthy about him and his AiG ministry, this association with these right-wing social media is remarkable. Each of these sites caters to vile, extremist hate groups that have limited access to other social media. Facebook has reprehensible content, but at least Facebook claims to attempt to keep the worst off. Twitter is almost as bad, but seems slightly more responsible in removing the worst posts, at least for the time being. These other sites are replete with racism, Q’Anon, anti-Semitism, anti-vaxx, and numerous other dumbfery. See the Wikipedia links above for further information about these far-right social media organizations Ham and AiG participate in.</p>

<p>Three tweets below the fold; it appears that Germany did not find the tweet actionable.</p>

        <p>This article is about the mass shooting that took place at the Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo, New York, on May 14, 2022 in which 10 people lost their lives.  While I am going to write about issues peripherally related to this tragedy, rather than on the shooting itself, this is by no means intended to overlook the loss and suffering that the loved ones of the victims and, indeed, the Buffalo community as whole are continuing to deal with at this moment.  I am sure the rest of the Panda’s Thumb team will join me in offering my thoughts and support to the people of Buffalo, as well as those affected by the more recent shooting in Uvalde, Texas, as they attempt to go forward with their lives and repair their shattered communities.</p>
<p>The horror of the Buffalo shooting was compounded by the fact that it was clearly racially motivated, with the shooter leaving a manifesto in which he expounded at length on the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory.  This has caused consternation among members of America’s Republican Party and the right wing media with which it is allied.  For some time now, the American Right has been making subtle, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/02/28/marjorie-taylor-greene-white-nationalist-conference/">sometimes not so subtle</a>, overtures to White Supremacists in order to bring them into their “big tent” as part of their political base.  Nonetheless, it remains a fact that many swing voters will be repelled by associations with such movements.  This likely explains why, immediately after the shooting, the right wing media went into overdrive trying to downplay the killer’s racial motivations and, instead, shift the blame to other less politically inconvenient targets, like <a href="https://gamerant.com/fox-news-violent-video-games-buffalo-shooting/">video games</a> and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tucker-carlson-blames-buffalo-supermarket-shooting-on-biden-mental-illness-ignores-great-replacement-theory-spread-on-fox-news/">mental illness</a>.  A question arises:  If the American Right was not courting the support of White Supremacists, then why would it be so important for them to deny the killer’s White Supremacist motivations?  I don’t really have a good answer for that.</p>

<p>If you have been reading, for example, <i>Skeptical Inquirer</i> for 40 years or so, you may think you have little to gain from reading this splendid, newish book by the eminent geologist Donald Prothero. You would not be more wrong.</p>

<p>The book, <a href="https://iupress.org/9781684351794/weird-earth/">Weird Earth</a>, is subtitled “Debunking strange ideas about our planet,” and debunk it does. I thought I knew a lot of the strange ideas about the planet, and indeed I did. But did I know the details? Usually not. Further, I had no idea that the earth is expanding (it is not), that Mount Shasta is riddled with tunnels leading to a secret city (it is not), nor that <i>ley lines</i> connect various points on a map (they do not).
Professor Prothero devotes 16 chapters to debunking these and other concepts in some detail. Mostly the exposition was clear and I understood it easily; only rarely did I have to grapple with a description or explanation.</p>

<p>The book actually contains 18 chapters. The first describes “Science and critical thinking.” This chapter briefly discusses how “[s]cience is a way of thinking about the world.” If I had one criticism, it would regard the common claim that scientists actively attempt to disprove, or falsify, their hypotheses. It is not as simple as that, though surely when good scientists find that their hypotheses have been falsified, they will react accordingly. Nevertheless, when Rutherford traveled to the south seas, he did not intend to falsify general relativity. (See my post and comments <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/04/scientific-attitude.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>The last chapter explains <i>why</i> people believe weird things and introduces such concepts as motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, backfire effect, compartmentalism and cognitive dissonance, and even tribalism. Professor Prothero marvels at the existence of “smart idiots,” who “selectively bias what they learn” in order to defend their (weird) beliefs to their followers. Indeed, he argues that “the root of most of our cognitive biases is tribalism,” a claim that, if true, requires a somewhat broad definition of tribalism. He goes back, convincingly, to the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine during the Reagan administration to explain today’s proliferation of nonsense on formerly reputable television channels. Were I writing the book, I might have combined this chapter with the first or made it the second, so that readers would more readily understand why people believed weird things, but maybe that is just a matter of taste.</p>

<p>A team of geologists from West Virginia University has discovered what are apparently living cells in halite (rock salt) estimated to be 830 Ma old and more than 1.5 km below the surface. You may read a summary by Michelle Starr in <i>Science Alert</i> <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/830-million-year-old-microorganisms-found-trapped-in-australian-rock">here</a>, or you may find the full article in <i>Geology</i> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1130/G49957.1">here</a>.</p>

<p>The geologists used optical and ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy and found what they think are algal and prokaryotic cells trapped inside liquid inclusions in the halite. It is at least possible that the cells are alive, judging by the fluorescence spectra.</p>

<p>I checked with a biologist, who confirmed my intuition that a seed or a spore, in order to remain alive, must display at least minimal metabolism. It is therefore hard to imagine a spore lasting for so many years, and indeed the <i>Geology</i> paper notes that the “microorganisms may survive in fluid inclusions by metabolic changes, including starvation survival and cyst stages, and coexistence with organic compounds or dead cells that could serve as nutrient sources,” that is, that they may have been active sometimes and dormant at other times.</p>

<p>Years ago, we used some green branches as tomato stakes. At the end of the season, we noticed some green leaves at the top end of one or more of the stakes. “How stubborn life is!” my mother exclaimed. She did not know the half of it.</p>
