Mr. Rintoul writes that the San Cristobal mockingbird "is found only on the island of San Cristobal and nearby Pitt Island in the Galápagos Archipelago. It was one of the first animals encountered by Darwin when he arrived on San Cristobal (which British sailors called Chatham Island) in 1835. Other similar-but-different species of mockingbirds, collected by Darwin on other islands in the archipelago, provided some of the first sparks for his ideas about speciation and common descent.

<div align="center">Old arguments never die, they just get recycled.  From Wikimedia.</div>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>It is the end of 2021, which has been a fairly miserable year for most of us.  So it is entirely appropriate for us to consider what is the most ridiculous argument put forward this year for ID or for creationism.  I’m going to give my own choice, which is both highly technical and highly absurd.</p>

<p>But you get to make a nomination of your own. (There will no winner chosen or prize awarded).  The argument need not be one that was first proposed in 2021, as long as it continued to be put forward.</p>

<p>My own choice is the Algorithmic Specified Complexity argument, which purports to show mathematically that
high levels of adaptation cannot be achieved, because the length of the “program” used is unusually short, and
this is backed up by very impressive, and sometimes quite correct, mathematical proofs.  The effort is usually
to show that the length of the program needed is conserved, so perhaps it cannot be changed by evolution.  Perhaps.    I’ve ranted and
raved in <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/12/Is-Algorithmic-Specified-Complexity-Useless-for-Analyzing-Evolution.html"><strong>another
post</strong></a>
about the wrongness of this two years ago here.  But the argument has never been disowned by any of its
advocates, including Robert Marks, Winston Ewert, or Eric Holloway.  So it is still out there.</p>

<p>Here’s why it is silly:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There never is any attempt by its advocates to show that an unusually simple program is needed for a highly fit
adaptation, and</li>
  <li>It is never clarified whether the “program” computes the genotype, the phenotype, or something else, and</li>
  <li>Even the name is ludicrous: “Complexity” is achieved by the program being unusually simple (the reverse of
the way algorithmic complexity theory is used to discuss random numbers),</li>
  <li>The distribution of binary bitstrings used is totally arbitrary, and there could be many others as well- (or ill-)
justified.</li>
  <li>When one asks about how any of this works, the authors of the theory simply say that they are not biologists,
so they leave the filling in of those details to the biologists, but</li>
  <li>Somehow they still expect people to consider their argument to be meaningful biologically.</li>
</ol>

<p>The argument has such a tension between its mathematical pretentiousness and its basic meaninglessness that
for me it achieves worstness.</p>

<p>OK, that’s my candidate for Worst.  What’s yours?  We have quite a few wise heads here who are quite familiar with the
arguments ID advocates and creationists make.  If you aren’t as familiar, just take a look at the Discovery Institute’s “Evolution
News and Science Today” site and start reading stories there.  It will supply
you with lots of candidates. Let’s hear from you, below in the comments.</p>

<p>A correspondent sent us this tweet by Ken Ham:</p>

<blockquote> There's only one way to go back in time &amp; that's to read the true history of the universe God revealed to us in His Word beginning in Genesis. "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?" (Job 38:4)</blockquote>

<p>It is Mr. Ham’s take on the recent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. I find it astonishing, even for something coming from Ken Ham.</p>

<p>First, it gives quoting out of context a very bad name. The story of Job is a horrible one (I have written a bit more about it <a href="https://people.mines.edu/mmyoung/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2019/01/Young_No_Sense_of_Obligation.pdf">here</a>, pp. 160-168). In the book, God gives Satan permission to torture Job and kill his family, for no other reason than to win a bet with Satan. Job, in contrast to God, seems to believe in justice or fairness, and calls out to God to show him his guilt. God’s response is to mock Job. Chapter 38, the chapter cited by Mr. Ham, reads (according to the 1985 <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/Job.38.4?lang=bi">JPS Tanakh</a>),</p>

<blockquote> <p><sup>4</sup>Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations? </p>
<p>Speak if you have understanding. … </p>
<p><sup>6</sup> Onto what were its bases sunk? </p>
<p>Who set its cornerstone …? </p> </blockquote>

<p>God to goes on to browbeat and belittle Job. Though God never addresses Job’s concern, Job finally gives in, admitting that he is “but dust and ashes.” How such a reprehensible story buttresses the case for creation escapes me.</p>

<p>Second, and perhaps worse, a careful reading of the text shows clearly that its author thought of the earth as a solid object with a physical foundation and a base that was sunk into something (perhaps like a pile driven into the earth?). Unsurprisingly, then, we find that Mr. Ham is quoting as an authority an author who thinks that the earth is a flat slab, possibly sitting on some unknown foundation into which piles have been driven, and probably with a dome over it. (Possibly that foundation is sitting on a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">turtle</a>.) Hardly a portion of the Bible that I would want to quote if I wanted to cite an authority on the creation of the earth. But with Mr. Ham, we never know. Any out-of-context quotation will suffice.</p>

        <p>For readers who have not been following this controversy, I thought I would point out Jerry Coyne’s article on <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2021/12/13/new-zealand-authorities-stand-firm-in-desire-to-teach-maori-ways-of-knowing-alongside-science-in-high-schools-and-colleges/"> New Zealand’s intention to teach Maori “ways of knowing”</a> alongside science in schools and universities. Dr. Coyne has been following the situation for some time now, but the article I cite, his latest as of now, provides a good summary.</p>

<p>The scare quotes (“ways of knowing”) are Dr. Coyne’s, but to my mind they are entirely justified. True, the Maori and other indigenous peoples have learned a great deal about their environments, but much of what they “know” is palpably untrue. Indeed, many indigenous peoples, including the ancient Hebrews, tell what are essentially creationist myths and are therefore demonstrably false. These myths are also generally mutually exclusive. They may be appropriate in anthropology or history classes, but they are not science and do not belong in a science class, except conceivably alongside phlogiston in a unit on the history of science.</p>

<p>The New Zealand policy, though obviously well-intentioned, is frankly pandering. It leads to the following question: Must we teach Iroquois “ways of knowing” in New York, Navajo “ways of knowing” in <strike>New Mexico</strike> Arizona, and astrology in Boulder, Colorado – all as if they were science?</p>
