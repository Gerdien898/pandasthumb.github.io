        <p><i>WWU’s Huxley College of the Environment may be renamed after a bizarre report uncritically plagiarising far-right creationist &amp; conspiracist materials gets Thomas Henry Huxley exactly backwards on racism.</i></p>

<p><i>From 2004-2007 Dr. Nick Matzke worked at the National Center for Science Education, including the <u><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover.html">Kitzmiller v. Dover</a></u> court case that determined that teaching “intelligent design” in public schools was unconstitutional. He obtained his Ph.D. in Integrative Biology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2013. He is now a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland. This essay represents his personal scholarly views, not those of current or former employers.</i></p>

<p><b>Update, November 2021:</b> A similar situation has now broken out at Imperial College, London. A “History Group” review of colonialist legacies at Imperial has decided that the important thing to do is to target a Huxley statue and building, as well as room named for J.B.S. Haldane (apparently for discussing cloning; never mind Haldane’s strong socialism, critique of hardline eugenics, and explicit anti-imperialism). The name “Imperial College” appears to be untouched. An outline and list of “Key Links” has been added, along with various corrections/clarifications.

<strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Western Washington University’s <a href="https://huxley.wwu.edu/">Huxley College of the Environment</a> was founded in 1969, the year of the Santa Barbara oil spill, when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire, and when Earth Day was proposed. It is now one of the oldest and most prestigious environmental colleges in the country. It was named for Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-1895), famed not only as Darwin’s defender after the 1859 publication of the <i>Origin of Species</i> (<a href="https://www.linnean.org/news/2019/07/01/1st-july-2019-why-there-was-no-darwins-bulldog">“Darwin’s Bulldog” came into use in 1895</a>), but also for his remarkable career, rising from a family too poor to pay for school to becoming a leading anatomist (proposing the kinship of humans with the great apes, and birds with dinosaurs), geologist, ethnologist, and philosopher (coiner of the word “agnostic,” foe of Social Darwinism). Above all he was a leading figure in making science a profession (rather than a hobby for priests and the landed gentry), and making a liberal science education available to all.</p>

<p>Despite accomplishing more than most could ever dream for science and public science education, Huxley is now in the dock at WWU. The main charge is racism, with many at WWU calling for Huxley College to be renamed. WWU’s president commissioned a <a href="https://president.wwu.edu/research-and-resources">Legacy Review Task Force</a> (LRTF) which issued a <a href="https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-07/LRTF%20Report%20and%20Recommendations_June%202021.pdf">Report</a> making the rather elliptical claim that Huxley’s “ethnological accomplishments were grounded in white supremacist values that dehumanize and harm many members of the Western community.” More directly, the Report indicts him for advocating polygenism (the idea that different human races are separate species) and “many negative generalizations on the basis of race.” Another charge was that “Huxley’s claims about the inexhaustibility of fisheries has contributed to the decline of the salmon runs that are central to Coast Salish cultures.”</p>

<p>Are the accusations correct? A large debate could be had about the substantial difficulties of fully understanding the views of historical figures, let alone judging them. But clearly universities should not ignore major relevant evidence, nor rely on badly biased and one-sided presentations of the evidence.</p>

<p>I try to keep up with the Discovery Institute’s site Evolution News and Science Today’.  It used to
be called ‘Evolution News and Views’ but they presumably wanted to emphasize that all that was
published there is hard factual information, so they changed the name.  I am getting a bit
behind: on the 24th of September there was a remarkable article written by Brian Miller, the Research Coordinator
of the DI’s Center for Science and Culture.</p>

<p>Under the title “Nearly All of Evolution Is Best Explained by Engineering” <a href="https://evolutionnews.org/2021/09/nearly-all-of-evolution-is-best-explained-by-engineering/">his
post</a> notes a
report that, as it describes “Transposable elements modify gene regulation in maize to confer drought tolerance,
alter flowering time, and enable plants to grow in toxic aluminum soils.”  He also mentions a number
of other cases in which organisms adapt rapidly in ways which seem to him to be the result
of their being engineered to do so.  His report is one in a series on a Conference on Engineering in
Living Systems (CELS) given in June and sponsored by the Engineering Research Group (ERG) of
the Center for Science &amp; Culture of the Discovery Institute.  Proceedings of the CELS conference
seem not to be available online at this point.</p>

<p>To Miller, this seems to be evidence of the correctness of James Shapiro’s hypothesis of
Natural Genetic Engineering (NGE).  Shapiro’s view and many references to his summaries of it
can be found in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_genetic_engineering">Wikipedia article on NGE</a>.
He thinks that organisms adapt by containing mechanisms that propose, not random genetic variation, but
the genetic variation that is specifically needed in the current situation.</p>

<p>Among advocates of ID, this has been greeted with enthusiasm.  At Uncommon Descent, their in-house
science reporter “News” (Denyse O’Leary) made a similar comment about a report that reptile teeth
were gained multiple times in evolution, <a href="https://uncommondescent.com/evolution/reptiles-evolved-de-evolved-re-evolved-teeth/">on
10/16/21</a> she noted that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In short, when researchers actually looked at reptile tooth history, it was hardly a simple evolution tale at all. It seems as if there are plans that life forms can access, perhaps within their genomes. But how do they trigger the needed changes, as opposed to just going extinct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of natural genetic engineering that responds adaptively by making the needed changes in the
genome, rather than by having natural selection pick them out from among available variation, is wildly
popular among ID advocates.</p>

<p>But there are a few questions that need to be raised …</p>

If I had not been familiar with <a href="https://sinaiandsynapses.org/">Sinai and Synapses</a>,* I might have dismissed this <a href="https://ejrsme.icrsme.com/issue/view/1643/222">special issue</a> of an obscure journal as yet another attempt to use science to rationalize religious beliefs. It is nothing of the kind. The entire issue consists of essays by Fellows who have been supported over the years by the Sinai and Synapses organization, about which I have said a few words below, in an Endnote. The Fellows are experts in their fields and mostly faculty at secular universities. All of them, I am certain, know what they are talking about.</p>

<p><br />The front matter contains helpful synopses of all the papers. Sometimes, I admit, the synopsis was all I wanted. I learned, however, that a second-century CE rabbi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ha-Nasi">Judah ha-Nasi</a>, had noted that “pestilence” often transferred from pigs to humans, so Rabbi Judah recommended fasting whenever pigs suffered pestilence. I wondered why on earth such an influential rabbi would care one whit about pigs, so I naturally turned first to the article, “Zoonotic pandemics and Judaism’s early-modern turn to science,” by Jonathan Crane of Emory University. I was relieved to find that Rabbi Judah did not raise pigs, but he had nevertheless noted the similarity between pigs’ organs and humans’. More strikingly, he recognized that diseases could be contagious and could be transferred from pigs to humans. Rabbi Crane introduces us to later Talmudic scholars who, in addition to citing earlier scholars and relying on their expertise, adduced their own evidence and required confirmation. Specifically, medieval Jewish scholars such as Maimonides accepted the scientific knowledge of their day, and the early modern period found Jews embracing “exogenous knowledge as well as the emerging means to discover and develop it.” Rabbi Crane continues, “To be precise, scientific method and evidence matter when it comes to physical issues like medicine and public health.”</p>

        <p>I was looking at a post today at Uncommon Descent, wondering what strange interpretation they were going to make of this palaeoanthropology report from 
Smithsonian Magazine.
On my browser, in the middle of the post there was an ad.  I know that the UD site is not responsible for which ad gets put onto the page when I view it.  In this case a bot seems
to be responding to the word “footprint”.</p>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/2021/Screenshot20211022.jpg" alt="[UD post with ad]" />

<p>
The advertising bot appears to have decided that <em>Graecopithecus</em> needed relief for sore feet.  It does not realize that 6 million years ago hominids did not have 
Amazon accounts.
