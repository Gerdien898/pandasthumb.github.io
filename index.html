<figcaption>Enlargement of detail <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/">from Elisabeth Bik’s blog</a>, one of several illustrations showing apparently duplicated areas within the key figures of the paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3">A Tunguska sized airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam …</a>. </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I shared the excitement when I read <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97778-3">here</a> that “in ~ 1650 BCE (~ 3600 years ago), a cosmic airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam, a Middle-Bronze-Age city in the southern Jordan Valley northeast of the Dead Sea,” and that this event could have given rise to the biblical account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Somewhat to my surprise, Ken Ham of <i>Answers in Genesis</i> did not. I now think that Ken’s conclusion [1] was right and I was wrong.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Like I suspect many of the journalists and interested readers who swooped on this story, I failed at first to notice that the paper was not, despite the link, an article in <i>Nature</i> but in <i>Scientific Reports</i>. This is one of the stable of second-line journals closely linked to <i>Nature</i> being published by Springer, now controlled by the publishing giant Hotlzbrinck, and profiting from <i>Nature</i>’s reputation for excellence. I was only vaguely aware of the authors’ long history of invoking airbursts, took the many kinds of evidence listed at face value, and did not even blink at the claim that “[a]n airburst-related influx of salt (~ 4 wt.%) produced hypersalinity,” a process for which I can envisage no credible mechanism. <br /></p>

<p>The authors have since described this work to a much larger audience in <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-giant-space-rock-demolished-an-ancient-middle-eastern-city-and-everyone-in-it-possibly-inspiring-the-biblical-story-of-sodom-167678">The Conversation</a>, where they <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w">repeat their claim</a>, also published in <i>Scientific Reports</i>, of a similar catastrophe at Abu Hureyra in what is now Syria, around 10,800 BCE, assert that “it almost certainly won’t be the last time a human city meets this fate,” claim that such events “pose a severe modern-day hazard,” and advise that “unless orbiting or ground-based telescopes detect these rogue objects, the world may have no warning, just like the people of Tall el-Hammam.” The Abu Hureya paper also repeats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas_impact_hypothesis">a litany of earlier claims</a> that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas">Younger Dryas</a>, a period of severe cold in the northern hemisphere from around 12,900 to 11,700  years Before Present [Present is fixed at 1950 CE], was caused by a  series of impacts with cometary debris, spread over at least four continents. These claims have been severely disputed; see papers listed below.<br /></p>

<p>Prominent among the critics is my friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Boslough">Mark Boslough</a>, an expert on such cataclysmic events who even has an asteroid named after him. He tells me that he is tired of repeated rebuttal of what he considers to be obviously false claims, and of seeing his own theoretical analysis of the effect of airbursts invoked as an explanation of claims completely inconsistent with such a process, or perhaps any credible process. For this reason, rather than publishing yet another counterblast that will be ignored, he has taken to describing the controversy, extending over many years, on Twitter (see <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/1440097126856282113">here</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/1440378973309968391">here</a>, and subsequent threads).<br /></p>

<p>There are numerous reasons for concern about the Tall el-Hammam paper in particular.<br /></p>

<p>The paper tells us, “The project is under the aegis of the School of Archaeology, Veritas International University, Santa Ana, CA, and the College of Archaeology, Trinity Southwest University, Albuquerque, NM, under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.” <a href="https://viu.ves.edu/doctrinal-statement/">Veritas International University believes in</a> “the full historicity and comprehensibility of the biblical record.” It is accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), which I have written about <a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2013/11/credit-where-none-is-due-creationist-colleges-and-courses-i-am-browsing-school-science-textbooks-pub.html">elsewhere</a>. Trinity Southwest University, which now operates from an office in a strip mall in Albuquerque, was formerly in Tulsa, Oklahoma, under the name Southwest Biblical Seminary, and rejects any government accreditation whatsoever as intrusive violation of the separation of Church and State. While the traditional site of Sodom is in Israel (and within the pre-1967 boundaries), Tall el-Hammam is in Jordan.<br /></p>

<p>The corresponding author is Allen West, who has been publishing prolifically in this area since 2005 (<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6434d1px">Evidence for the Extinction of Mammoths by an Extraterrestrial Impact Event</a>) and in 2006 co-authored a book, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=d1ooDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=%22Allen+West%22&amp;ots=9QLiSjyrE3&amp;sig=6pEWeeRLpuPRJeGozdWInxrMUsw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Allen%20West%22&amp;f=false">The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes: How a Stone-Age Comet Changed the Course of World Culture</a>, which claims  that the debris of a shattered comet was responsible for  “a cosmic chain of events [that] began 41,000 years ago and culminated in a major global  catastrophe  28,000 years later.” These events include everything from the extinction of the mammoths to the landform of the Carolina Bays to the legend of Atlantis to a purported “mysterious layer of black sediment” found spanning North America to the Younger Dryas discussed in the Abu Hureya paper.  West has no academic qualifications or affiliations and gives his address as Comet Research Group (CRG), Prescott, Arizona (several of the other authors are also members of this group, <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/">which is linked</a> to the <a href="https://www.authortalk.audio/">Rising Light Group</a>, a 501(c)3, tax-exempt charitable organization with a clear Christian and biblical agenda, registered in <a href="https://www.authortalk.audio/501-c3.html">Allen West’s name</a>. As <a href="https://psmag.com/environment/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180">detailed by Pacific Standard Magazine</a>, discussing how thing stood regarding CRG’s work in 2017, there have been calls for a formal inquiry, and</p>
<blockquote> University of Wyoming archaeologist [Todd Surovell](http://uwacadweb.uwyo.edu/SUROVELL/) and his colleagues couldn’t find increased magnetic spherules representing cosmic debris at seven [Clovis sites](http://www.pnas.org/content/106/43/18155.abstract?sid=49d79c32-625b-4cdd-bbb2-3ff3254f8a46). [Nicholas Pinter](http://www.geology.siu.edu/people/pinter/index.html) and his colleagues at Southern Illinois University Carbondale argue the carbon spherules are organic residue of fungus or [arthropod excrement](http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2010GL043345.shtml). And [Tyrone Daulton](http://physics.wustl.edu/people/daulton_tyrone-l) of Washington University in St. Louis and his colleagues reported that supposed [nanodiamonds formed by the impact were misidentified](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16043).</blockquote>
<p>Numerous other concerns specific to the present work <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/37B87CAC48DE4BC98AD40E00330143">have been presented</a> at PubPeer, and <a href="https://scienceintegritydigest.com/2021/10/01/blast-in-the-past-image-concerns-in-paper-about-comet-that-might-have-destroyed-tall-el-hammam/">very detailed concerns</a> have been raised by Elisabeth Bik in her blog, Science Integrity Digest, where she presents evidence that images in the paper had been manipulated.<br /><br /></p>

<p>On the other hand, in an acrimonious exchange with me in the Comments section of <i>The Conversation</i>, Wells pointed out,</p>
<blockquote>Our group included, among many others: Dr. James Kennett, emeritus professor at UCSB, specializing in stratigraphy, micropaleontology, paleobiology. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, which recognizes the contributions of just 0.1% of all scientists. Dr. Ted Bunch, former NASA section chief and a world-leading meteoriticist. Dr. Robert Hermes, retired from Los Alamos National Labs, world-recognized expert in trinitite or atomic glass. Dr. Wendy Wolbach, chemistry professor who discovered high-temperature soot at the K-Pg boundary.</blockquote>
<p>I replied with a listing of some papers that I have examined criticising West’s own earlier work regarding airbursts, including sampling techniques and claimed evidence for very high temperatures:<br /></p>

<p>We await his decision with interest.</p>

<hr />

<p>[1] Though not his reasoning, Ken’s argument is based on his Ussher-style <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/bible-timeline/how-does-mans-history-fit-with-the-biblical-timeline/">biblical timeline</a>, which places the call of Abraham at 1922 BCE, whereas the destruction of Tall el-Hammam is dated to ~ 1650 BCE. For what it’s worth (not much, I know), this disagreement would disappear if we use, instead, the traditional Jewish date of 3760 BCE for the Creation.</p>

<p>I have not read Stephen Meyer’s new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G122JJN/">Return of the God Hypothesis</a>, subtitled “Three Scientific Discoveries That Reveal the Mind Behind the Universe,” and possibly will not. I had not been aware that the God hypothesis had ever gone away, and 700-odd pages of what looks like old hat seems perhaps a bit excessive.</p>

<p>Fortunately, what may look to some like an unlikely source, the right-wing blog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(website)">Ricochet</a>, may have saved me the trouble: They recently ran a splendid “<a href="https://ricochet.com/1059644/stephen-meyers-return-of-the-god-hypothesis/">critique</a>” of the book by <a href="https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1535406429/clearer-thinking-with-spencer-greenberg/liberalism-and-conservatism-with-cassandra-xia-and-hank-racette">Henry Racette</a>.</p>

<p><i>Guest post by <strong>Dan Phelps</strong>, to whom we are indebted for unearthing this whopper from Answers in Genesis:</i><br /></p>

<p>Once again, creationists are misrepresenting a recent dinosaur discovery. This time it is a large carcharodontosaur from Uzbekistan that was recently described in a paper, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210923">A new carcharodontosaurian theropod dinosaur occupies apex predator niche in the early Late Cretaceous of Uzbekistan</a>, by Kohei Tanaka and colleagues from the universities of Tsukuba, Hokkaido, and Calgary.<br /></p>

<p>On today’s “Answers News,” an online news video by Answers in Genesis, their employees (including Ken Ham’s son-in-law, Bodie Hodge) discuss this dinosaur. The discussion can be found from about 9 minutes, 30 seconds to about 14 minutes in <a href="https://youtu.be/4Jhf2eKXwAc">this</a> YouTube video.  As is par for the course, they ignore the actual publication and rely instead on popular press discussions such as <a href="https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2021/9/9/22664700/tyrannosaurus-rex-ulughbegsaurus-uzbekistanensis-bigger-dinosaur">this one</a> . They also add their bizarre creationist interpretations and claim the fossil was buried in Noah’s Flood. <br /></p>

<p>Even more ridiculously, they suggest the theropod dinosaur – the apex predator! – may have been a vegetarian. This would be amusing except that AIG is misinforming children and adults via such broadcasts as above, the Creation “Museum,” and their Kentucky-taxpayer–subsidized “Ark Encounter.”</p>

<p>The Board of Trustees of Huxley College met the day before yesterday, September 17, <a href="https://trustees.wwu.edu/files/00%20BOT%20Sept%202021%20Work%20Session%20Agenda%20-%20FINAL.pdf">solely to discuss renaming the college </a>. According to a source whom I prefer to leave anonymous,*</p>

<blockquote>[T]he consensus seems to be to drop the Huxley name. They acknowledge that there was lots of information submitted both in support of and opposed to dropping the Huxley name. They acknowledge that Huxley did lots of great stuff both as a scientist and as a strong abolitionist and a defender of universal human rights, and in expanding educational opportunities for a diverse audience. However, they were troubled by some of the bigoted and sexist language that Huxley made at times. They also point out that Huxley had no real links to the Pacific Northwest or North America. Fair point. It sounds like they just don’t have the stomach to deal with the blowback of rejecting the <a href="https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-07/LRTF%20Report%20and%20Recommendations_June%202021.pdf">Legacy Review Task Force</a>. No decision but it seems clear where they want to go.<br /><br />

They then went on the discuss <a href="https://president.wwu.edu/files/2021-02/WWU%20Building%20Names%20Report%20Sept%202020.pdf">Mathes and Haggard</a> [two dormitories]. They are not inclined to reject these two, in spite of the majority recommendation of the Task Force to do so, and made comments along the line that “you should judge people based on the standards and language used in their time, not by modern standards.” Interesting that they are not inclined to use the same standard for Huxley. They want to judge him based on modern standards.</blockquote>

<p>It is curious that they only now discovered that Huxley had no direct connection to their area. If I wanted to be suspicious, I might suspect that they plan to change the name of the college on a pretext.</p>

<p>Another source thought it was</p>
