<p>Daniel Phelps of Lexington, Kentucky, is the recipient if the 2021 Strimple Award of the <a href="https://www.paleosoc.org/who-we-are">Paleontological Society</a>, an international nonprofit organization devoted exclusively to the advancement of the science of paleontology. The Strimple Award recognizes outstanding achievement in paleontology by someone who does not make a living full-time from paleontology. Contributions may be an outstanding record of research and publication, making outstanding collections, safeguarding unique paleontological materials through public service, teaching activities in the area of paleontology, and collaborations with others working in paleontology. The award will be given online as part of the Geological Society of America annual meeting in Portland, Oregon on October 12.*</p>

<p>The Paleontological Society is the world’s leading scientific organization for studying invertebrate and vertebrate paleontology, micropaleontology, and paleobotany. The Society has membership in 40 countries and consists of professional paleontologists, academicians, science editors, earth-science teachers, museum specialists, and undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, as well as avocational paleontologists.</p>

<p>Daniel Phelps is well known to readers of PT. He is President and founder of the <a href="http://www.uky.edu/OtherOrgs/KPS/">Kentucky Paleontological Society</a>. He is a retired environmental geologist for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He has also taught geology part-time in Kentucky’s Community College system and once worked for a major petroleum company’s Plano, Texas, research center. Dan is also Vice-President of Kentuckians for Science Education. He was a major participant in the documentary “<a href="https://www.webelieveindinosaurs.net">We Believe in Dinosaurs</a>,” which aired on PBS’s series Independent Lens in February, 2020 (see, for example, <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2016/12/we-believe-in-dinosaurs.html">here</a> and <a href="https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2019/04/reviews-of-documentary.html">here</a>).</p>

The most powerful evidence in favor of common descent is what’s called the nested hierarchy of life. Other scientists may have their own candidates for most powerful evidence, and might say that the most powerful evidence comes from within their fields. A paleontologist might point to the fossil record. But I’m a phylogeneticist and I’m writing this, so nested hierarchy it is. Also, since I work with molecular data, I’m going to talk most often about DNA sequences. But what I say applies to all sorts of other data too: proteins, anatomy, behavior, whatever heritable features an organism has.
<p>

 "Nested hierarchy”, stated most simply, means that species can be organized into a branching tree: species at the ends of the twigs, meeting in branches, that themselves meet other branches, and finally coming down to a meeting of all branches at the root of the tree. Further, the tree represents the actual pattern of branching descent, with each joining of branches representing the common ancestor of all the species above it.
<p>

But of course the tree diagram itself is evidence of nothing; you can draw a tree for any combination of species, and in fact you can draw any number of different trees connected in different ways for the same combination. What makes the tree evidence is that you use data to determine the tree, lots of data, and that different samples of data consistently determine a particular tree rather than a bunch of wildly different ones. For example, consider a very simple tree of four species: human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. How do we know those species are related by common descent? There are fifteen possible ways to arrange these four species into a tree, and the one supported by most evidence is tree #1 in the figure above.
<p>

We also need some way to decide which tree the data fit. I’m going to use a very simple criterion, parsimony. Other criteria are more complex, but the way they are used is the same. Under parsimony, the tree that most simply accounts for the similarities and differences among the species is the one that fits. Consider, for example, the two characteristics (characters, for short) shown in the figure above, character #1 in blue and character #2 in red. Each of them has two possible values, or states, that we name A and B. In the tree at left, look at character #1 (again, in blue); the human and chimp both have the state A, and the gorilla and orangutan share state B. That’s  most simply explained by a change in character state, from B to A, happening in one branch of the left-hand tree. But the same character would require two changes to explain the distribution of A and B among species on the right-hand tree. For that reason we say that character supports the left-hand tree but not the right-hand tree. (Character B, the one in red, supports the right-hand tree but not the left-hand tree) If we collect a great many characters and they all support the left-hand tree, that’s good evidence of a true nested hierarchy and thus a true tree of descent.
<p>

Any questions?
